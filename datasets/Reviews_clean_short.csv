( amazon should mentioned that this is the kettle potato chip review forum ! : ) i happy to report that kettle backyard barbeque flavour totally delicious ! ( at least they in the one-ounce bags ... hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same ! ) definitely for adults however -- and/or whose stronger-than-adult taste buds withstand the very strong flavour of they not the strongest flavour i ever had ... that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me ! backyard barbeque by kettle however just the right amount of sweetness ( with honey powder onion sugar ) to the edge of the stonger flavours ( paprika chili pepper cayenne pepper natural smoke flavour ) of which there is less ( they further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners ) the complete list of ingredients of kettle backyard barbecue ( in the 1-ounce bags hopefully in the 9 ounce bags as well ) is as follows : potatoes vegetable ( safflower sunflower ) honey powder ( dried cane sugar honey ) powder sugar onion powder powder paprika torula yeast powder chili pepper citric acid cayenne pepper paprika oleoresin ( colour ) natural smoke flavour natural ingredients the combination is a true taste treat ! of course as with all ptato moderation is the key. potatoes contain a lot of potassium .... which gives energy othr good things .... but too much of which damage kindneys the vegetable is great -- but too much ( as well as too much starch from the potatoes ) hurt the eyes natural smoke flavour is so yummy .... but it ( as well as sugar ) -- in very large amounts -- linked to cancer production as far as the starch from the potatoes this be ameliorated ( a bit ) by drinking tea ... which is good for the eyes but as far as the potassium ( energy - good too much -- bad for the kidneys ) the sugar natural smoke flavour ( too much to cancer production ) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything ..... m o d e r a t i o n ... ! twice or three times a i allow to on what i call a potato chip diet i only one large bag ( or the equivalent in small ones ) of potato all day i supplement this with tea coffee lemonade as well as servings of carnation instant breakfast essentials ( i like the dark chocolate flavour ) this adds up to fewer calories than i would normally if i had normal three meals a day plus snacks it also teaches me to s-l-o-w-l-y because that one big bag ( or little bags ) never lasts as long as i 'd like anyway with excercise sensible eating the rest of the ( keeping scale nearby weighing at least twice a day every day ) i 've taken off pounds in the last three months ! : ) backyard barbeque flavour potato from kettle totally scrumptious except for those jalapino ( which tasted good but were far too spicy for own taste buds ) i to meet a potato chip i did n't like to kettle backyard barbeque flavour potato with their combination of potatoes sweetness spices truly become one of top five favourites .... if not the very first favourite of all ! flavoured potato perfection !

's some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks the packets themselves really cleverly designed with a little slit cut in the folded part you just grab sides pull it opens up the package without any hassle - got ta love product design ! : ) another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top. each of the packets 210 calories ( 90 from fat ) about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option it does contain milk soybeans sheanut - so if any of an issue for you then you 'll want to pass it also says on the packaging that the facility they 're manufactured in also processes eggs peanuts - the product does n't use either of but the disclosure is nice if you 're particularly sensitive to either. overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets so that 's quite a few snacks one note if you live in a hot climate do n't order in the summer because they will melt together ( in ) ! duh ! : )
