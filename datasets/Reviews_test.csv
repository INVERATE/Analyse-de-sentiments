They are more expensive than grocery store Ramen and taste a good deal better but seem to have about the same destructive amounts of salt- 2020 mg or about 80% daily salt intake/bag which claims to be 2 servings but I assume that most adults would consume the lot unless using this as only part of a meal rather than a quick comfort food.  Other reviews alerted me to this and following their recommendation, I only used 1/2 the soup base package.  I added some dehydrated green onions and dried oinions when preparing on the stovetop and added a fresh egg, covering it with the noodles after removing from the heat.  This had excellent flavor and with half of the salt, I did not feel like my blood pressure would be so imperiled as I had used the whole soup packet.  I like and regularly consume very spicy food (I frequently consume 4-5 jalapenos with a meal) but as prepared it was quite delicious and spicy enough.<br />  There are other brands of noodles that I frequently buy from Amazon <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BCE97K"">Annie Chun's Korean Sweet Chili Noodle Bowl, 8.4-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)</a> that I relish but the salt is still high and the price is somewhat higher.  I will alternate varieties in the future.  I only eat Asian Noodles no more than once a week since I do have some sodium issues.<br />  I am on disability and do not get out often from my house in the country so I have tried many of the long shelf life foods that Amazon sells.  They sell many dehydrated vegetables in medium sized quantities that make them easy to have on hand and still be way cheaper than grocery store prices.  I even found some non refrigerated tofu <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTY7Y"">Mori-Nu Tofu, Lite, Silken, Firm, 12.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> that I have received but not yet tried.

The spice package is orange color, the real Korean Shin noodle is bright red in color and the noodle will not get mushy after 10 minutes.

I've eaten Ramen Noodles for quite some time and have found them to be a super inexpensive meal at .10 a package and sometimes cheaper.  I also like other readers mentioned don't always use the entire seasoning packet because of the high sodium content.  I found these noodles to have even higher sodium content.  Which I guess isn't too bad if you don't plan on eating the soup.<br />These noodles to me tasted just about the same as Ramen Noodles except the noodles were a tid bit larger in size.  If we are reviewing just the flavor packet, I would say it was pretty good.  Especially for those who like spice like myself.  I am use to eating super spicy foods and have a high tolerance to spice.  So they were right on par with what I am use to as far as the heat goes.  But I can see someone who doesn't eat spicy foods to find the seasoning super hot and spicy for them.  I like the idea of the dehydrated veggies that are enclosed to accompany the seasoning.  I am giving these noodles 3 stars because they are just overpriced Ramen in my opinion.  Plus the sodium content in the noodles is just unacceptable.  They surely can come up with lower sodium options. And lastly I give it 3 stars because of the price.  I would not expect to pay more than .50 cents a package for these noodles in a retail store. I would definitely buy these again but not in bulk."

The noodles are your regular, fried ramen...a tad thicker then common grocery store noodles.  One trick I use is after cooking the noodles, I rinse with water well...it takes that starchy flavor away that I don't care for and makes a fresher tasting soup.  The heat of this is strong, use a quarter packet to start, you can always build up.  Not much more flavor going on except the heat of the chili.<br /><br />I do love the Hoo Roo Rook noodles; they aren't fried and the noodles are round to fit your saucepan.  They aren't in the same heat category as these noodles, but they are nice for a more 'tender' palate that likes things not-so-spicy.<br /><br />*NEWSFLASH*  Okay, I'm coming to the end of this box of Spicy Picante and realized that I would sort of miss having my mouth burning while eating soup this winter...so on that note, I just may buy this noodle again -- it's a heat that kind of grows on you.  I did order the spicy seafood flavor and will see how that one goes.  All in all, this is an acquired hotness that takes getting used to if you're not used to heat (like me)."

Do they taste that much better than the 10 cent ramyun at the local grocery store? To my taste, they don't. I will concede they are slightly better and certainly more filling.<br /><br />As far as spicy.. I'm so confused on this. Every review says to use half a packet as these will burn your mouth off. So needless to say, I was expecting HEAT! These aren't spicy at all. To give you a frame of reference, I'm usually sweating after eating ""hot"" wings at Applebees. If you've ever gone to Buffalo Wild Wings, I have a difficult time eating the ""Asian Zing"" wings. I can't tolerate heat very well. However, I have a pretty mild burn going on in my mouth after eating a bowl with full spice, and it's not unpleasant enough to warrant a drink.<br /><br />So, all in all, not bad noodles.

I settled on Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun Gourmet Spicy Picante because of the high ratings. I don't mind spicy foods, but sometimes I find that when food is overly spicy it overpowers any appreciation for the flavor. This is my experience with Nong Shim noodles. My dh, who enjoys ramen noodles says these noodles have a slimy texture and I did have to agree with him the next time I tried to ""get in"" to them.

The timing decides whether the yolk will be soft or hard. To preserve the original spicy flavor, the egg should be hard-boiled in the soup. But some prefers to blend the soft yolk to the soup for a milder taste. There are a lot of people who blend the whole egg to the soup during cooking, this makes it a wholly different kind. Note, as more egg blends into the soup, you are more inclined to finish the whole soup, which is not too great for your health (too much sodium).<br />2. Add a slice of cheddar cheese on top of the prepared Ramyun in a bowl.<br />3. Do both 1 & 2.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars because Shin Noodle is too spicy for me."

I love spicy foods and not only does this satisfy my craving, but it's also full of flavor. The possibilities are endless when it comes to adding ingredients to this ramyun, but even if there is nothing added, it is still very good. I really like the packet of freeze dried vegetables that come with it. I have half a box left and I already know that I will be ordering more if I can't find something similiar in the grocery stores in my area.<br /><br />To address the sodium issue - yes, there is about half your days worth of sodium in one flavoring packet, BUT you most likely won't be able to handle the heat of one whole packet so you won't be consuming the full amount of contained sodium and if you do use the entire packet, just watch your sodium intake the rest of the day and double your water intake (you will probably do that anyway to cool your mouth from the heat, but it's a good burn :)). These aren't incredibly healthy. My boyfriend and I usually split one because there is a lot of noodles per package and it is so filling. You do not want to eat this for several days in a row, but a lot of things are okay in moderation. I whole heartedly believe that one package of these noodles is a heck of a lot healthier than anything offered at a fast food chain."

The cooking instruction is for full bag, so it's fair to note the nutrition contents for the whole bag as below:<br /><br />Calories: 560<br />Calories from fat: 160<br /><br />Total Fat: 18g, 28% of daily value<br />Saturated Fat: 9g, 46% of daily value<br />Sodium: 2080mg, 86% of daily value<br /><br />While the sodium content is on the higher end of foods, you have some control over this by adjusting the amount of power soup base.  Once I learned the nutritional facts, I use the full bag of noodles with half packet of the soup base.  The other method would be to cook the whole bag as usual, but immediately throw away 1/2 the soup to avoid the temptation of eating the whole thing.<br /><br />Lastly, my secret to best ramen is no secret to Koreans - after the noodle is dropped in boiling water for 1 minute, drop an egg and sliced spring onions and cook for 1 more minute.  Then, pour into a bowl by 3rd minute.  You'll know you did this correctly when the noodle in the bowl is ""almost"" 100% cooked where the noodle have come apart, but still somewhat undercooked.

The seasoning is far too spicy to eat these noodles dry, but the seasoning packet is perfect for seasoning soup.  Other types of ramen don't make the kind of flavorful soup that this one makes, but there is enough flavor in one packet of this stuff to flavor a LOT of water!<br /><br />A word of warning... this soup is VERY spicy.  I regularly eat hot wings, spicy potato chips, and I put extra hot sauce in spicy chili.  I like spicy food.  But this stuff is pretty harsh.  If you're very sensitive to spicy foods, I would avoid this one.  If you're mildly sensitive to spicy foods, just use a little extra water in the soup.  I wouldn't say this stuff is over-the-top spicy, but it has a pretty strong kick.<br /><br />I think the thing I like most about this type of ramen is how flavorful the noodles themselves are, even when they are made as a soup.  When I make ramen as a soup with other types, the noodles are almost flavorless.  But these noodles really soak up the flavoring very well.<br /><br />The one complaint I have is that I don't care for the vegetables that come in the vegetable packet.

I had fond memories of rice and noodle concoctions from my student days and I was drawn to these because of the many excellent reviews.  Indeed, after reading some, I fully expected my toes to tingle after eating these!  :)<br /><br />At first I really liked them, and yes, they are truly spicy.  I like spicy.  The spicier the better.  Besides, the reviewers are right- you can just put in as much of the spice packet as you want.  After a few of them, though, it occurred to me that the spicy wasn't like any Thai or Cambodian food I've had, or even straight up hot chilies like habaneros; the spice struck me as more chemical-induced.  Was it the MSG?  The other salts?  Whatever it is, it doesn't settle well with these taste buds.<br /><br />The more I ate, the less good they seemed to me.  After a while, I noticed that they always left kind of a gummy, coated feeling to the inside of my mouth.  Then I looked at the ingredients.... Maybe it is all the MSG, or maybe the beef tallow, or maybe all the sodium variants that I can't even pronounce.  Whatever it is, these are losing their appeal with every serving.  Now, I'm not a health foodie and despite the fact that one package doses you with 88% of daily value of sodium and 40% daily value of fat, I'm not holding that against it.  (to be fair, the previous amounts assume that you use the entire spice packet and each package counts as 2 servings)  It really comes down to that gummy feeling left in my mouth after eating a package, even using 1/3 of the spice packet.  I just can't get past that.<br /><br />The noodles seem like any other ramen noodles, and they are yummy.  It's also nice that they have a decent size packet of dehydrated veggies inside, separate from the spices.<br /><br />Taste is totally about preference, and I don't think this is a bad product just because it didn't work for me.  Also, I think they are priced right, especially if bought through subscribe and save.  I've got to go with my experience on the rating, though.

A dollar a packet really isn't that steep, and you realize this when you try them. First off, the packets are noticeably larger than other ramens, with quite a bit more noodles. Then there's the fact that it comes with a spice packet that seems larger and more filled than competing ramens. It also comes with a dried vegetable packet, a very nice touch. Make sure to read the instructions, they're a little different then other ramens (you just place everything in at once and cook). The taste is phenomenal, nice and spicy (especially if you add the whole packet) with firm noodles that are more chewy that ""normal"" ramen. A very nice Asian spicy flavor.

100123,B000LQORDE,A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q,Opinunated,14,22,3,1251504000,Two Tastes - Salt and Red Pepper - yet I like it. Add an egg and it really improves. Unfortunately it is far from healthy,"Don't under estimate the appeal of salt and cayenne (red) pepper for many ""soup lovers"" and reviewers. That includes me.<br /><br />However, this is nothing more than a watery Noodle Soup with lots of Red Pepper and a tremendous amount of salt. Add an egg and it tastes much better. Chop up some scallion and it further improves.<br /><br />There is nothing terribly impressive about this soup YET I like It. This dry soup mix consists of a large packet of noodles (essentially tasteless yet ladened with 500 calories of saturated fats) and two much smaller packets. One of these small packets contains less than a tablespoon of chopped dried vegetables and the other is a ""spice"" packet consisting largely of salt, msg and red (cayenne) pepper.<br /><br />Add some water and you have 2 1/2 cups of soup.<br /><br />Impressions: Beyond the watery base (there are no thickeners), my first impression was that of salt followed ---- after a few more spoonfuls -- of the emerging heat of cayenne pepper. As is typical with cayenne pepper, the heat builds up on the palate over time. Some might call this soup ""medium hot"" but for many I'd imagine they would call it ""very hot"". However, it easy to adjust the heat level - just add less of the salt/spice packet.<br /><br />But the only real tastes here are those of salt and cayenne pepper. The noodles are essentially tasteless and the vegetable packet is so small that it can add nothing more than visual appeal. However, I'll say it again, don't under estimate the appeal of salt and cayenne pepper!<br /><br />This soup can be greatly improved by cracking an egg into the mix and stirring it in during the last minute of boiling. The egg not only adds a much needed third taste but also thickens the soup considerably. I was quite surprised how much an egg improved this soup. Make no mistake - adding an egg really changes the character of the soup.<br /><br />At the [...] I paid - with shipping - for a case of 20 -- this soup was a good value.<br /><br />I'd give this soup 3 or 4 stars with an egg but I'm a bit biased toward anything ""hot"". Maybe 3 stars with an egg is most appropriate and 1 or 2 stars is more accurate for this soup without an egg?<br /><br />HEALTH WATCH: One packet of this soup provides almost 90% of an individual's daily allowance of salt!!!!! That is a stunning amount of SALT. Plus this soup has 40% of the daily allowance of SATURATED fats (thanks to the palm oil used to fry the noodles). With almost 500 calories, you'll be adding a few inches to your waist line if you eat it regularly. It is shame the company choose palm oil to fry its noodles in (presumably to save a few cents) and added so much salt. It makes this soup needlessly unhealthy. It is, in fact, a poster child for all that is wrong with processed foods. I have to add the ingredient list is truly frightening with a long list of chemicals - far more than is typical - even in processed foods. This is probably not a soup anyone should serve more than once a month. View this soup as equivalent to a bag of potato chips, no more or less healthy.<br /><br />Another HEADS UP - some of the reviews on Amazon strike me as a bit suspect: There are a number of 5 star reviews generated by One Time ONLY Amazon reviewers. Once these ""reviewers"" have promoted this company's product - they never publish another review. I've seen this same pattern, time after time, for all the other soups made by this particular company.<br /><br />Finally, everyone should keep in mind how hard it is to believe that any dried soup with a tiny ""flavor packet"" could ever rate 4 or 5 stars among people that have a serious love of soup. Consider too, the simple fact that very few of the soup's ingredients are even readily identifiable as a ""food"".<br /><br />My thanks to the previous reviewers who suggested adding an egg. It made a world of difference<br /><br />THIS SAME SOUP IS SOLD in CASE LOTS OF: 20 PACKAGES, 30 PACKAGES or 40 PACKAGES. ALL OF WHICH ARE LISTED SEPARATELY ON AMAZON. The prices differ on a package by package basis too. Generally the 30 pack, which ships for free, is the better value."

I'm a white dude from TN so i'm not the hugest ramen authority though.<br /><br />I just got this in the mail, ripped it open and threw one in some water:<br /><br />- Spicy as hellllllll.

I was skeptical of them, but it added to the ramen nicely and tasted good.<br />- I added in an egg.  Eggs make all ramen better.  This ramen was no different.<br /><br />Yep, its a bag of noodles."

In my opinion, everybody here complaining about the whole spice packet being too much must have grown up on hotdogs and hamburgers, or equally not-spicy foods.<br /><br />A tip when cooking the noodles is to cool them in air while the noodles are boiling. Repeat until you see noodles become firmer, perhaps about 5 fork/chopstickfulls for the whole bowl (alot of noodles per utensil-full) and you can taste the difference.<br /><br />As always, eggs, garlic, ground red pepper, sri rancha(?) sauce or other condiments are good.<br /><br />In Korea the standard for cooked ramen would include 1egg, green onions, sometimes onions, and sometimes small dumplings.<br /><br />Red meats are okay to put in, but are less cost-to-taste effective when compared to hams or dumplings."

You buy a pack of Maruchan chicken noodles and you get chicken flavored noodles. A pack of Shin noodles sits in a screaming hot spicy broth (soup?) that runs off when you pull out a bite. The noodles you get on the end of your fork are left mostly flavorless after the broth runs off. This then leaves you with a bowl of screaming hot spicy broth, not a format that I enjoy.<br /><br />BUT - I have found that if you don't follow their ""soup"" directions and instead add just enough water to hydrate the noodles you get quite a different experience, the noodles retain all the flavor and there is no broth.

Like other reviews on here mention, I got these noodles at my local asian market and they were awesome - thick, springy noodles that put regular ramen to shame.<br /><br />I then saw Shin at my ""regular"" grocery store, and picked some up - big difference.  The noodles were thinner and had no ""bite"" to them, nothing like the ones that turned me on to this brand.  I opened up one of the packs I got from the Asian market to make sure, and they're definitely different noodles.<br /><br />So, maybe the ones I got at my regular store came from a bad batch etc., but it seems more likely that there's an ""American"" and ""Korean"" version, with the ones sold in American stores using a noodle that's more like what Americans are used to.<br /><br />In any case, see for yourself: the product is hot, spicy and incredibly flavorful.  A great buy regardless of the noodle.  But if, like the rest of us, you fall in love with these noodles and find yourself craving them, head down to your local Asian market to try the Shin they sell there.  It's a bit better, but both are head-and-shoulders better than the 10-cent ramen bricks most of us know as ramen."

The price is reasonable too and free shipping with Amazon Prime or free shipping with purchase over 25.00.The only fault I could find, in my opinion, is that the product has lamb.  I won't eat lamb and have never before bought any dog food with lamb or veal in it. I do not like the way the animals are treated and lambs are sweet, baby cuddly things. It makes me sad.  Unfortunately, this company uses lamb in most everything for some reason.  I have never seen this before in a dog food  product. They might have one or two items with lamb, but not most all.

I have 6 special-needs' rescued Greyhounds and although they all require a different 'diet' because of their problems, I keep this on hand in these two grain free 'flavors' as an occasional 'add in' to the fresh-food diets I prepare for them on a daily basis. I have relied on this to get me through their 'picky-eater' times, their 'on-medications-that-taste/smell-funny-and-I-don't-wanna-eat-Mom"" times, their upset tummy times, their 'post-surgery-feeling-icky"" times as well as when I don't plan right or run out of something. This grain free product comes in very handy and I like that it is pretty close to 'natural' ingredients. Frankly, there is another brand I would prefer but I simply cannot afford it.<br /><br />I've been more than happy with this product because it is grain free. I cook fresh, whole grains for my 'kids' in their daily diets so to find grain free canned food to keep on hand for 'in a pinch', I like this. ok, so I loved it until the last 6 cases I had delivered. For years, this canned product was almost solid in the can. I needed a spoon to dig it out and I loved the way I had to actually mash it into the rest of their food. The last 6 cases (both flavors: 3 of the salmon and 3 of the ALS) seem to have a change in the recipe. I open the can and can literally POUR it into their bowls. There might be one larger blob of 'food', but for the most part, it is like a healthy soup. I purposely do not purchase the other Canidae canned foods that contain broth because I can make them all kinds of much healthier 'broth' on my own. I don't know if these last 6 cases are this way because they sat in a warehouse for a long time and the food actually broke down or what. To those in the 'know' that may sound dumb but I have no idea why this product would change so drastically and I have to admit I'm disappointed greatly. While this is something I can afford, my disappointment is now to the level where I'm back to considering the more expensive product I wanted all along. I'll just buy less of it, less frequently.

For a while, I'd found near-perfection in the Coffee People extra bold mix... especially the Wake-Up Call (which got horribly expensive all of a sudden), but even those I only made on the middle setting of our brewer, and never the largest.  The Double Black Diamond still satisfied me on the largest setting, and has an intense, smoky dark edge that reminds me of the coffee that first converted me to the Pacific Northwest style of espresso---one I had a a tiny, roadside espresso stand out in the middle of nowhere between Tumalo and Sisters, in Oregon.  (It's probably not there any more--this was back in the 90s. LOL)  Anyway, it's definitely robust, and as I use milk/creamer, I don't find it bitter at all, but rich and worthy of savoring.  It will stand up nicely to a shot of your favorite flavor, and even shines through getting mixed with cocoa and vanilla for a toasty mocha.<br /><br />I just wish the coffees I'm finding out that I really, really like weren't shooting up into the ""Can't Afford"" ranges.

When placing in cup holder, make sure the little hole on the bottom from first use puncture is at the top and fits back onto the bottom pin - that way you do not get 2 holes in bottom of Kcup. You can resuse the Kcup many times befor it wears out.<br /><br />In the morning I will start off with GM Double Black and then for 2nd or 3rd cup use one we filled. Someday's I splurge and start with Barista Italian Roast.<br /><br />If you like strong, bold coffee, try the Black Magic. It is smooth without much of a bitter after taste. Although, I kind of like that after taste. It is too bold for my wife, so I tell her to reuse the Kcup I just used and make an 8oz cup... makes a good cup of coffee, just not quite as strong... and we get 2 cups out of the one Kcup."

I hesitated to buy Timothy's Espresso Blend (now the only espresso k-cup on the market) due to the reviews but have since tried GMC's Dark Magic and now GMC's Double Black Diamond.  Double Black Diamond doesn't have the flavors the Espresso Blend has but it has a very good flavor on its own.  It has no bitter aftertaste as you would expect with such a strong, extra bold coffee.  Where the Dark Magic was too weak for my daily latte, the Double Black Diamond makes for a very fine latte.  This is my pick as a substitute for GMC's Espresso Blend.<br /><br />Update: I've been drinking this coffee for a few weeks now and have to say, it is great.  It is my new favorite!  Also, bought a couple of Extra Bold Roast k-cup coffee sample packs via Keurig and haven't found any better than GMC Double Black Diamond."

I have been soooo disappointed with all of the K-cup coffees because they are so mild. After reading reviews, I decided to try all the ones that were said to be good, strong coffees.  First I tried Jet Fuel.  It is strong, but no taste.  Then I tried Paul Newmans dark roast.  It was so so, but nothing special.<br />I saw the Big Easy k-cup and thought, this must be it.  It is good. Don't get me wrong.  It is my second choice.  But the winner is  Green Mountain Double Black Diamond! It is really, really good.  If you like your coffee strong and bold with great flavor, this is the one.  I don't care what it costs.  It is worth it."

When compared to traditional coffees, it is comparable to Cafe Du Monde. I am actually quite surprised it doesn't have chicory in it. It is bold and rich without being at all bitter. Prior to this coffee, I thought Starbuck's Italian roast was the boldest commercial blend. But, Double Black Diamond makes it look weak in comparison. It brews to an almost jet-black and is very dark and earthy without a hint of bitterness or sweetness. It is very much like an espresso and I suspect it may contain as much caffeine.

I brushed a little olive oil on it and covered the steak liberaly with the rub.  The grill was at 675 degrees and I ""seered"" both sides for about 3 minutes.  Took it off and let it set for 5 minutes.  It had a mild chared look on the outside and was a perfect midium rare on the inside.

I ended up getting a pack of these Easy-Mac to-go cups since I loved easy-mac as a kid. They worked out pretty well!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Easy - very simple instructions, no additional stuff needed (except about a cup of water). Following the instructions on the pack yields the exact advertised product<br />2) Quick - 3.5 minutes in the microwave!<br />3) Similar to stove-top Easy Mac - taste is very similar to the stove-top version. Though consistency is not (see below).<br />4) ample cheese sauce - my gripe with Easy Mac is that sometimes it lacks in the cheesiness (compared to other quick-type macaroni and cheeses such as velveta). This comes with a pretty good size pack of cheese mix, and definitely carries through in execution.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) noodles are a bit mushy - This is obviously not fresh, homemade pasta,  and the noodles are a little mushy after cooking in a microwave on high power. Doesn't particularly bother me though, but if you're a pasta snob (cough, Scott Conant, cough), you may wanna steer clear.<br />2) Takes a while for sauce to thicken - The instructions require that you add the cheese sauce mix after you microwave the pasta alone. Then you stir for a while until the cheese sauce thickens to your liking. It will take a while. In my experience, expect to face an additional 5-7 minutes of stirring the hot pasta with sauce before it thickens to the traditional consistency of Easy Mac (ie. macaroni and cheese).<br />3) Small portion - I'll admit, this is probably an item that is targeted for children, but in any case, it's a fairly small portion. More of a snack than a meal. Then again, I don't think I'd really like an entire meal of Easy Mac...<br /><br />Overall, it's a small pack that's easy to throw in my bag on days I don't have access to a fridge to keep my lunch cold. It's quick, easy, and requires no additional items to make (again, aside from water). If ever I need this kind of item again, I will definitely purchase!"

I've always loved plain Quaker rice cakes, so when these tiny cheesy treats came out I knew I had to try them. I actually devoured a whole bag by myself a week ago- they are that delicious. They're crunchy and light and SO yummy. The cheese flavoring is actually a mix of both cheddar and blue cheeses, so I think that is what gives them a nice unique flavor. I can seriously sit and eat a whole bag within minutes. I try to savor each one but they're so yummy I just can't. They are really the most perfect snack out there- a far better choice than something like Smartfood or Cheddar $ Sour Cream Lays (both snacks I was partial to buying before I discovered these).

Burgher ""Snappy's mom""",5,5,4,1326153600,Been using this for years...,My husband has suffered for years and feeding him on his gluten free diet has been difficult. I found this flour through a gluten free oats producer and have been so happy with the product. With this I have a bread recipe that I can make in the bread machine that is really good. I make him cakes and cookies and breads using regular recipes and they come out great. Because of the lack of gluten I often have a problem making things like pie crust but I manage. Because of the lightness of the flour I do have to make sure it is all incorporated in the bread machine and scrape down the sides in the beginning but the it makes it so easy to make him bread in only 2 hours. Since you only have to let it rise 1 time you can make it quicker than some other styles of bread. Being able to purchase from Amazon will make it more convenient and I am grateful more people will become familiar with this great product. For those that suffer with Gluten Free intolerance this is a really good product that works with most recipes that you already have in your kitchens.

I was introduced to it four years ago, through a local celiac support group.  It is a cup-for-cup replacement for all-purpose flour in your own favorite recipes.  You can even use it to make a roux.  In some recipes, I find it best to add a tad more flour or a tad more liquid -- but I can tell whether I need more of either as I am mixing the ingredients.  And, with some recipes, I do need to increase the baking time as gluten-free flours do tend to take longer to bake.  I use it for cakes, cookies, muffins, bread and breading for fried foods, pie crusts and other pastries, gravies and roux, waffles, whatever.  I have noticed that foods fried with Domata Living Flour do not absorb as much oil as foods fried with all-purpose wheat flour, so they are crisper and they reheat well without turning soggy.  I don't need extra gluten for pie crusts, but you can add a tad more xanthan gum if you find that it is not quite stretchy enough for your pastry recipes.  The taste and texture are equal to all-purpose wheat flour.  Baked goods may not rise quite as much as with a wheat flour, but I find that the cakes and muffins are still the same size as they were when I made them with all-purpose wheat flour.  I have shared this with many celiacs or those who cook for celiacs, and it has been a hit with each and every one.  One note:  if you are using an old bread recipe, remember that gluten-free dough has no gluten to be developed by kneading and does not benefit from the second rise that some recipes include.  You can do either without harm, but there is no advantage to doing so.<br />This is the one gluten-free flour I must have in my kitchen."

Hershey's Special Dark with Almonds is not as intense, but it is smoother, not as sweet as the milk chocolate--which I don't prefer--and it contains a satisfying amount of almonds that aren't chopped up into tiny pieces.  When I don't splurge on something more intense and expensive, this is always my second pick unless somebody has another brand that's more concentrated on sale.  As it is, HSDWA is more amenable to breaking down in your mouth because it's a bit creamier than your usual darks, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  It's just rich enough to win over all those milk chocolate fans who are hesitant about going too severely dark, and it's not repellently sweet like a Cadbury can often be.  Just like Coke Classic, it's hard to beat a Hershey bar in price and quality, so if you find the gourmet bars a bit too harsh and pricey, this may be the way to go.  As for me, I'm easy, and that just makes me a chocolate 'ho'(Yes, I've said that before!), and variety is the spice of life.

To frame how I feel about this Green Mountain Colombian K-Cup I feel it might be best to share how I go about making a cup of Dunkin' coffee when I'm at home.<br /><br />I use a coffee scoop to measure out my coffee.  To my tastes, the perfect home brew is 7 mounded scoops and 7 cups of water.  I put all this in my Cuisinart 1200 and come out w/ 6 cups of java bliss.  I use sugar and milk in my coffee; when I make my coffee as stated it get a satisfying mocha swirl of coffee and milk.  Just by sight I can tell my cup is rich.<br /><br />Now, using that as my baseline, I find this K-cup to be very satisfying.  I have tried MANY kinds of regular coffee K-cups, and this is the first one that makes a satisfying cup of full bodied coffee to my tastes.  Granted, I brew on the 6oz setting.  If you take your coffee black maybe you can get away w/ the 8oz setting.  The cup reminds me of my beloved Dunkin' (note I said reminds, its clearly not Dunkin' but I don't mean that in a bad way).  It doesn't end sharp or bitter like the very popular Coffee People Donut Shop.  It has a muted finish, reasonably full body for a K-Cup, and nice flavor.  When I pour in the milk, I can take more than a drop before turning the cup white - which tells me the cup is rich.<br /><br />Its my go to cup when I'm not brewing a pot.<br /><br />I love this stuff.  I highly recommend it if you like your drip coffee as I describe above.  Why not 5 stars?  Well, it doesn't taste like the Dunkin' I brew from a drip machine, that's why !  Its at least on the same field though ..."

This tactic gets quite expensive.<br /><br />The weakest point of a Keurig are it's boldest blends cannot touch an actual strength of a Starbucks French Roast which my wife packs into a cartridge in the Keurig daily as she is used to French Press and Keurigs weakest point are it's weak coffee blends in about 90% of the cartridges I've tried.  I like Columbian Coffee taste but this stuff comes out like TEA even with the lowest volume of water.  If you favor a weak tea blend then this is your cup of tea not coffee. ;)

The vet told me to give her Glucosamine & Chondrotin. I went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the ""chicken flavor"" tablets. For such a large chain, tablets were the only product they carried. They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog.  On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online.  They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it. My little Echo has perked up, jumps, runs and one would never know she has this condition.  This condition, at this stage, is correctable only by surgery; thousands of dollars which I don't have. I thank the founder of this company, Patrick in memory of his dog Zuke. They also donate to the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund. I know this is a long review, but that's just because this product really deserves kudos.<br /><br />As a side note, my pain management physician also recommended ""Golden Aloe"" daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis. So she both and is doing well.

I searched the internet and read reviews for several days, each time my reasearch led me back to this product. Off I went to the local pet supply store to get this treat.

He gets one each day after breakfast and expects it.  He has had two knee operations which was one reason we looked for a treat targeted for joints, etc.<br /><br />I only rated a 4 because I have no idea if the Zuke's hip action really does work in terms of improved mobility.  Yes, he loves the treats; yes, he walks every day; and yes, we're hoping the Zuke's is working to aid his mobility.  Nevertheless, he loves the Zuke's treat and we like the fact that they're made in the USA and are natural.  Just note of caution for Bichon owners with urinary stone issues; don't feed a Bichon beef products.  The chicken is great.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/17/10<br />I've updated my rating to a 5 because I recently took our dog to the vet who confirmed, at the age of 12 going on 13, he has no arthritis.  In fact, both front and back legs have full mobility.  I do attribute part of this success to his walking every day but also to Zuke's hip action treats.  Digby's had a Zuke's hip action treat for years and this treat is the only joint action remedy we feed him in addition to Nupro All Natural Dog Suppplement for his other nutrients, minerals, and vitamins.

He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.<br /><br />That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?<br /><br />Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GS0BY"">Nutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables</a> (I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues).  Anyway, my quest for a non-pill form of Glucosamine and Chondroitin led me to Zuke's Hip Action.<br /><br />I love that it's wheat, corn and soy free.  My boy has skin allergies and I've been doing my best to keep his diet as clean as possible.  Each treat has 300 mg of Glucosamine and 50 mg of Chondroitin.  The treats also have antioxidants thanks to cherry, blueberry, rosemary, turmeric and seasame seed.  BTW - turmeric is a great Indian spice that also helps humans because of its anti-inflammatory benefits.  It also has egg shell membrane meal, which according to the package helps support joint health.  So, it has good stuff in it.  It's also made in the USA.  After all the issues with Chinese-made dog treats, avoiding treats from China is important to me and the health of my dog.<br /><br />For a small 46 lbs and under dog (like my Ozzy), only one treat is necessary per day.  For a medium dog of 98 lbs and under, 2 treats a day is necessary.  For a giant dog of 138 lbs and under, 3 treats are needed per day.  Each package has about 23 treats in it.  If you have a larger size dog, it definitely can get pricey.<br /><br />I feed Ozzy the peanut butter flavor, because, well, peanut butter is one of his favorite things in the world.  Each treat is square and has a moist look to it.  It has an interesting smell - not one of my favorites, but not completely a turn-off either.  Just...interesting.  But the best part is he LOVES them.  His eyes actually bug out more than the usual chihuahua buggy-eyed look, and he happily grabs it and runs off to enjoy it.  He looks forward to it every day.<br /><br />Ozzy recently had surgery on his ear, and during the time after his surgery, he was pickier than ever with food.  He refused to eat even the raw beef patties that he usually loves.  He barely even took the peanut butter hiding his eye vitamins, probiotics and antibiotics (and this is a dog that loves peanut butter)  But these Zuke treats?  Heck yeah! Never a problem.  Just goes to show how much he loves these treats."

Our 9-year-old shepherd mix is literally a different dog since starting to take these treats. For the past couple of years he's been acting quite old - slow, not much energy, and often would have arthritic-type pain in this shoulders & hips. He would play for a couple of minutes and then lay down, totally uninterested in continuing. You could just see in his eyes that he was tired and old. A variety of supplements hadn't done much, and we felt awful that all we could do was give him aspirin for the pain. We switched his food to one with higher glucosamine, but it didn't make much of an identifiable difference. Last month, after he'd been significantly worse with shoulder & hip pains for a few weeks, I went online to research arthritis supplements and orthopedic pet beds (the last step before deciding to put him on medication). After reading reviews on these Zukes Hip Action treats, I decided to give them a shot and bought two bags on Amazon. OH MY GOODNESS!! It's been about two or three weeks now, and I am BLOWN AWAY. He's acting like a 5-year-old! He has more energy, he's jumping again, and his eyes look so much happier! That's the best part, to see him happy & excited again. Previously, it had been years since he would run with me any longer than about twenty minutes, and by the end of the run I would be dragging him behind me... this week I took him for a run and he went with me for an HOUR! And he was still ahead of me when we finished!! We're so hopeful that he'll be able to enjoy his ""golden years"" without the misery of a poorly aging dog.

His hips were so stiff when he walked, his gate stilted and he never ran anymore.<br /><br />A friend and I were talking about his decreased mobility a few weeks ago and she recommended we try glucosamine and chondroitin, so we purchased Zuke's Hip Action (beef.)  After two weeks of feeding him a double dose, we've noticed a HUGE change.  While some stiffness in his hips is still evident, he's been running around, jumping on the bed, jumping up on his back legs and playing much more often and for longer periods of time.  Where he would once play for a few seconds and then lie down, he's now begging to play and run around.  I can't wait to see his progress in a month.  We plan to reduce the amount to the one treat a day (recommended for his size) after 6 weeks, per recommendations I've read online.  We're also giving a treat to our new puppy every day to ward off any future problems and keep his joints healthy (he's a greyhound mix with really long legs, so we're concerned about the various bone/joint problems that he could be prone to.)<br /><br />As far as taste, both dogs LOVE these treats, more than any other we've tried in fact.  We'll be giving Zuke's as a daily supplement from now on, as we're firm believers in the benefits of them.  I'm so glad to see my old friend acting like a puppy again.  Thank you Zuke's!"

I started Zuke's Hip Action  a little over 2 weeks ago. Yesterday for the first time in months she came upstairs during the day while I work in my office. And today she jumped on the chaise for a nap.  I figure there is no placebo effects for animals so that can't be it. The treats must have had an effect on her mobility and pain. I will be a repeat customer.

First, my dog has not liked any other Glucosomine treats I've given him in the past. The pills were difficult to get in him as well. I was also skeptical I would see any difference. My dog is a 12 year old Husky-Great Pyrenese mix and weighs about 100 pounds. He has extreme arthritis is all four legs and it is increasingly difficult for him to go up and down our stairs. After giving him 4 of these treats per day for a little over a month now, we are seeing a difference. I am so surprised! He seems to feel better and though the steps are still a challenge, he is getting up them in one try now instead of three of four tries. And, most importantly, he loves these treats! Thank you!

Anyway, because of this fluke purchase, his mobility and attitude improved by ""leaps and bounds"" within two weeks!  He no longer cries or yelps when he tries to get up and he is much more playful.  Bucky, our dog, is also allergic to corn.  It isn't easy to find a ""treat"" that doesn't have corn.

I don't know how many calories are in a treat.  We use this in conjunction with a senior glucosamine /condroiton dog food. The 1lb pk that we purchased was $17 and a 45 minute trip out of town.  I'm down to one treat. He takes three (huge dog) a day.  I decided to see if I could get it on line.  Everything I found was still expensive especially with S&H.  And, then I thought maybe Amazon.

Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy. It caused her immense pain when moved in certain positions and caused her to limp. Running fast was out of the question and jumping was only for the lowest of heights. Even when she sat her left leg would be out to the side at an awkward angle. She was stuck in a catch 22. She couldn't make it stronger because it hurt and it hurt because it was so weak.<br /><br />We tried glucosamine supplements, but they were powdery and she seemed to not like the taste. The chicken jerky with glucosamine all seemed to be from china with an FDA advisory for liver and kidney problems.<br /><br />That's when I found Zukes hip action. The first time I opened the package the dog danced on her hind legs just to get a better sniff. The squares are soft and dense. They split into smaller pieces easily for training or to extend the reward time. The dog is sure to find even the smallest crumb. These treats last a long time with a small/medium sized dog like mine.  The bag makes a satisfying crinkle sound the dogs listens for. I really like that they are high quality and made in America.<br /><br />The improvement began immediately and after a few weeks of daily treats the difference was in the use of her hind leg was amazing. More cushion and flex in her hip let her use her leg more. Now she is much more active with better behavior and lots more running and jumping. She even sits down with both legs under her. Another thing I noticed was when she would lay in her bed on her back her bad leg would be pulled in. Now both legs spread out like normal for easier tummy rubs. When she is being silly she even army crawls. I only wish we had found them sooner. If you saw this dog running around you would never know she had a hip problem in the past."

I had never heard of Wild Olive Oil<br />before so I came home and did some research. The first thing I found was that this line<br />of Olive Oils is used exclusively in one of the world's best restaurant, El Celler de<br />Can Roca (3 Michelin Stars), of Girona Spain. Proprietor, the celebrated Joan Roca,<br /><br />OK, that got my attention. Then I found the company website with amazing detail on the<br />process to harvest and process these wild (organic) olives.<br /><br />""Our Wild Organic Olive Oil come from the point where Spain's largest river, the Ebro, flows into<br />Catalonia from Arag&oacute;n. A number of artificial lakes were created during the last century to generate<br />electricity. Here on these arid slopes some 600 metres high, near the village of Riba Roja d'Ebre, grow<br />numerous stubby Arbequina olive trees, small and contorted and often very old.<br /><br />The unique advantage of this altitude is that there is no incidence of the infamous white fly Dacus Olei,<br />which presents such a big challenge to organic olive farmers at lower altitudes. This means that Can Solivera<br />can grow E.U. certified olives here without the use of pesticides.<br /><br />Once harvested, our Wild Organic Olive Oil is pressed in one of the last remaining traditional stone mills in<br />Spain. The olives are ground by 3 huge granite wheels and then pressed in a pile of some 65 round straw mats.<br />The oil is then decanted from the ""alpech&iacute;n"" by gravity in large masonry cisterns.""<br /><br />Armed with this and other information I could gather, I went back to the shoppe, bought a 17oz.<br />bottle of this amazing stuff along with some fresh French bread, and made a beeline for home.<br /><br />All I can say is this, the Gods of Olympus must surely have a bottle of this on their dining<br />table. Its that good. Its light but earthy, medium bodied but full flavored and very fruity.<br />Its great for just dipping, or in salads or for finishing. And this price is very very reasonable.<br /><br />I've always been a fan of the Spanish Olive Oils, and now I'm even more attached. Thanks to the<br />wonderful people at Solivera(dot)com for all the great background information, and for this amazing<br />gift to the culinary world. 5 Pits"

I've tried the high priced stuff, Royal Kanin, Iams, even Paul Newman's offering which smells better than the stuff I feed myself.  He eats it, of course, but not joyfully, not with that Cocker Spaniel enthusism.  Plainly put, when Stanley eats something he loves, he sends up a spray and every fiber of his doggy being exudes joy.  Yeah, I know, so do I, thanks for bringing it up in front of strangers.  We're talking about the dog, so beat it.<br /><br />Anyway, until now, only people food...but specially prepared for Stanley (vet approved menu: chicken or beef, baked boiled or broiled, fat removed, diced and mooshed together with selected fresh vegetables)...elicited this kind of enthusiasm. I am not averse to cooking for my dog, but it would be nice to be able to open up a can every so often instead. Particularly when there is only one piece of chicken left and I want it.  A friend told me that his finicky dog loved Purina, to the exclusion of all other canned offerings, so I tried it.  Country Stew, Lamb and Rice and this ""Gravy with Beef"" which sounds unappetizing, but smells fine, are his favorites.  He still prefers a nice piece of beef and has absolute and undisputed dibs on the white meat from every chicken, but this rates a ten on his tail-wagging unbridled joy of eating scale.<br /><br />I should point out that Stanley also eats bugs when he can get them, so while the word ""choosy"" might describe his eating habits, so does disgusting.  But no matter, he's the best Good Boy ever and deserves the best...whether it's people food, dog food or the occasional crawly thing."

We have been using it the last six months.  I have purchased some of the most expensive canned dog foods at a local pet store and he will not eat the stuff.  If I have a bag of high quality kibbles and mix it in with the Pedigree, he will not eat his food.  We tried Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Eagle Pack, Holistic Select, Innova, Merrick, and Natural Balance.  I don't know what is in these higher quality cans of dog food he does not like.  Maybe too many vegetables??  He will even hide and pout if I put that stuff in front of him.  One time I left the food out for 15 min., put it away, and tried the next day.  He just would not eat the food.  He just loves the smell and taste of Pedigree, and he will even eat Alpo on occasion, but he will not eat the expensive dog foods, which I am more than willing to purchase for him.  I talked to two vets about this.  They tell me dogs go by odor.  The worse something smells the more they like it.  This is why many dogs will roll in dead things out of doors.  We do try to balance out his diets with apples, carrots, etc., if he will eat them, plus the dog gets a vitamin with minerals each day.  Of course he will eat cooked meat if I give it to him, and often we will give this to him with some rice or whole wheat pasta mixed in.  If someone can tell me how to get him to eat the better canned or kibble dog food that so many folks think dogs should be on, then I would like to know this.  Also, the reason we started using Pedigree is because we have some friends (and their relatives) who have had many dogs over the years and feed them Pedigree.  These dogs have lived to a ripe old age.  The biggest thing that got them down was arthritis, but the Pedigree never killed them.  So, this dog food may not be high quality, which I agree when compared to Blue Buffalo, etc., but it does not seem to affect their life span.  I am sure there will be folks who will tell me differently, but for those folks I know personally, they have not found any problems with this food for their dogs.  Amen."

I don't taste any chocolate and not really any cherry (even tart) it's more just a chemical reaction with no flavor. it's actually similar to their chocolate chili bars - I love both of those things too and love the combination but rather than getting chili flavor and heat you somehow only get the unpleasant heat and no flavor."

They are like gluten-free Kitkats, which is wonderful.<br /><br />However, they also smell like potatoes.  The chocolate covers the potato taste and smell, for the most part, but, it's still a little bit like eating chocolate-covered crispy potatoes.<br /><br />However, as you are probably aware, there are variations in what people can taste and smell.  Personally, I can tell what vodka was made from--potatoes, wheat, whatever--even though it's so finely distilled that there shouldn't be any way to distinguish that.  If you're not super-sensitive to tastes and smells, you probably won't notice the potato at all, in which case, these would be fabulous."

They have somehow managed, with very difficult flours, to make normal junk food.  (These kinds of cookies are sold in American supermarkets in packages that are three times the size.)<br /><br />The packaging is pretty;  the cookies are crispy, light, and very appealing in your hand.  They are an exact duplicate of the wheat version.  However, once you get them up to your nose, you can smell the potato flour they are made from.<br /><br />Pull them away from your nose, and you have a very pretty cookie.  Bring them back in to your nose, and it's a surreally icky potatoey experience.  Cookies like this shouldn't smell like potato vodka.<br /><br />They do have a chocolate-covered version of this that you can't really smell, because the flour is covered. It's such a sugar rush that you may not care what it tastes like, particularly because it has an excellent chocolate-sugar-bomb wafer cookie texture.<br /><br />Just hold your nose."

We were on our 3rd box when I opened one of the bars and went to bite into it. It was the equivalent to biting into some sort of spongy rock. I immediately spit out what chocolate had fallen into my mouth while biting it. The bar itself seemed extremely stale to me. I went ahead and opened the remaining 3 bars in the box and the rest were normal. I also noted on the package that the product is made in Israel then processed in Canada, then sent to USA to be bought. It seems to me like one of the bars I had floated around a facility for quite some time before it was actually packaged and sent. Or worse who knows. I'm glad it was me and not my 3 year old son who bit into it.<br /><br />I tried contacting Glutino about what happened. I tried calling several times as well as sent messages via the internet. But no response. It went from being suspicious to down right scary, what are they hiding and if this is how they treat their costumers- how do they treat their food?<br /><br />Please be forewarned. Going gluten free isn't easy and Glutino is a big brand on the celiac's grocery list but since our incident we avoid Glutino at all costs."

First of all, Glaceau is distilled MUNICIPAL water. Second of all, buying this product for the sole reason that it is  distilled water isn't very advantageous to your health or is a waste of money. Distilled water does more harm than good. Drinking distilled water for a long period will remove necessary electrolytes from your body such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and several trace elements that are absolutely necessary for your health. These deficiencies can cause irregular heartbeat and high blood pressure. So what if it contains electrolytes. The average person is not doing very strenuous activities that requires them to drinks with added electrolytes because he/she is profusely sweating out electrolytes  onto skin. Water has naturally occurring electrolytes. Also, fruits and vegetable are good sources of electrolytes."

He is 3 1/2 and healthy (or at least he WAS until recently).  He has routine physicals including bloodwork for kidney problems so I didn't worry when I read that this food can cause problems with underlying kidney disease.  One day he began having diarrhea and refused to eat... I thought, no big deal dogs get tummy upsets once in awhile, right?  But he didnt get better.  His Belly and hind legs started to swell so much that the skin looked like it would tear...  multiple labs and fecals showed kidney disease of unknown cause.  He has had ultrasounds, multiple blood and urine cultures, a plasma transfusion and is now on multiple medications.  His BUN/CREAT has shot up and he now refuses to eat ANYTHING.  His entire diet consists of water, pills and whatever vitamin paste I can force him to take.  My heart is breaking for him...  I can't do anything and feel helpless.  If it goes on much longer without improving I will face the horrible decision of humane euthanization.  I feel that it was caused 100% from the high protein diet.  We can find NO other cause and he has no underlying kidney disease.  Please choose a different food and save the pain that my dog and I are going through right now.<br />UPDATE>>> Not long after I made this review Ollie lost his battle to acute renal failure at the young age of 3.

Evo has the highest meat content in any dog food I've seen.  My dog loves the small bites.  It is very high in protein, so I do not recommend this to people who have little dogs unless they are very active.  I have a 8mo old Belgian Malinois and her breed needs good quality food as she is a working dog.  She did have diarreah in the beginning, but I think its because I switched it from red meat to chicken too fast.  So, if you are planning to switch to Evo, just make sure you take at least 10 days to fully switch it to Evo.  I am serious, I never wait that long, but with this high of protein, you really need to transition this food slowly.  Otherwise, your dog will have a rumbling tummy and possibly poopy accidents in your house.<br /><br />The wet food is amazing too.  It contains quality ingredients and even smells decent.

Iams and, Eukanuba in particular, were a cut above other mass market dog food brands, and were only available through specialty pet stores and veterinary clinics. (Note, one can't compare their original foods with the quality of our present products, as premium all natural dog food, as we know it today, did not exist in the 1990s).<br /><br />Shortly after the acquisition, P&G expanded both Iams and Eukanuba to the mass market, making it widely available in supermarkets and retail stores such as Costco, K-Mart and Walmart, across the globe.<br /><br />Within months of the takeover, it became very apparent that changes had been made to the formulation of the foods. There were numerous accounts of dogs and cats suddenly developing various health issues and dog food allergies -- from diarrhea to intense itching, brittle and poor quality coats, skin rashes, hot spots, and even blown coats.<br /><br />The packaging remained unchanged, and no notification was given to retailers, pet owners or vets. (Note: Pet food companies are not required to list ingredient changes on dog food labels for 6 months -- a legal loophole for P&G).<br /><br />After much publicity and a huge public backlash, P&G admitted to switching ingredients from rice to barley, but denied making any other formula changes. They went as far as adding a PR page to their website in an attempt to dispel what they referred to as ""rumors"", and insisted they were continuing to use the same quality ingredients as before!<br /><br />In April 2000, P&G implemented another strategy in an attempt to further reassure the public of their ""emphatic commitment to maintaining the premium quality of Iams and Eukanuba dog and cat foods"" - and that - ""any product changes that occured were designed to enhance the product"". They convened an independent seven-member panel, known as the Iams Quality Review Board, consisting of veterinarians, breeders, research nutritionists and pet specialty store owners. The members met at the Company's Ohio plant to observe and review the manufacturing process and analyze and compare ingredients lists against product samples obtained over the past twelve months"

Carbohydrates can be a problem with most pasta, due to the processed white grain product that used to make them, but this pasta is made from whole wheat, a far more wholesome option.  Because of this fact, it has a deep and rich flavor, which I have never found in any other kind of pasta, and unhampered by unhealthful added sodium salt.<br /><br />I bought 5 bags, and filled a gallon jar, which left two bags to spare.  With my nose in the jar, is smells _exactly_ like whole wheat, and you can see the bran in the noodles.  When it is cooked, it looks like regular pasta.  Due to the fact that it is unseparated semolina, the cooked noodles are a little brittle, but it tastes much better than the regular stuff.  Don't worry, this is the real deal.  This pasta is dream pasta!  Congratulations to an insightful manufacturer.<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus<br />[...]"

But after getting a case four months ago, the last two are still in my refrigerator, and I just can't bring myself to choke them down. They're just too cloyingly sweet for my taste. It's possible that my low carb regimen has made me just too sensitive to sweet taste, but I still use Adkins shakes and don't cringe when I go to consume one.<br /><br />Also, the Adkins shakes are about the same cost per ounce, but are smaller. These are pretty big (17 oz), so you better be ready for a big shake. Even when I started, I routinely threw away the last two or three ounces, so that's another mark against them compared to Adkins, which have a portion size more in my range.<br /><br />I think these work better for someone who's more on a body building regimen than a weight loss one.

Amazingly, they have no sugar and are pretty low in fat.<br /><br />For the Cookies & Cream, I'm still on the fence about the flavor.  I love the Vanilla and I've been drinking 4-5 of them per week for years.  The Cookies & Cream tastes as advertised when it goes down.

First of all, I'm a fan of Bigelow teas.  They're always full of flavor and the individual foil packages keep the tea fresh for a very long time.  This tea has become one of my favorites.  It has a great pumpkin spice flavor and I found it's the best with a little milk and sugar.  It's good without adding anything, but adding milk and sugar (or whatever sweetener you may use) makes it taste almost like pumpkin pie.<br /><br />Many pumpkin-flavored beverages out there fall flat when it comes to the pumpkin spice flavor, but this tea nailed it.  I'm glad it comes in a pack of 6 boxes because I'm sure it's going to be hard to find once winter is over."

Taste is still a little bland, but there is something very slightly bitter to it (perhaps the licorice, I do not like licorice root).<br />*I prefer my teas Iced and  1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-2nd steep (3.5) - On the second steep the flavors and scents finally come through and produce a more respectable cup however still on the weaker side for me.  It should be noted the 2nd steep will stand up to a longer steeping time. Tried a 3rd steep and it was too weak.<br /><br />Summary- I paid more for this than on Amazon by ordering a holiday tea collection direct from Bigelow (the single box on here was to much and I wanted variety. I love Halloween and as such pumpkin things tend to suck me in, for the price it is on here I would not discourage purchase however just know there is better out there. If you are looking for something to get you in the mood for fall, this will do. I will happily finish the box, but unless it is clearance at a store I do not plan to purchase more.<br /><br />If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp) ""steep"" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference.  I use plain lipton loose leaf for now but I can't wait to try this with plain rooibos when I get it.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my other tea reviews this is only my 2nd so far."

Ask your physician before drinking this, OK?<br /><br />Anyway, the pumpkin flavor is noticeable and the spices complement it well.

It's optional, but when I brew, I like to add just a touch of chai tea flavoring (I use the Torani syrup).  Once ready, I add a sweetener packet and top it off with a little milk.

The frosted coating on the underbelly is nice and sweet, and the nuttiness of the bar itself has more depth than a standard health bar, that can come off tasting like cardboard, but I still want something more.

It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in."

As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).<br /><br />This price is amazing, too.

I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor.

I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea.

Finally I put wax paper underneath it, rolled it out and flipped it onto the cake.  Easy enough.....or so I thought until I saw all the wrinkles transferred from the wax paper...back to the drawing board.

I won't be using it until this weekend, so the only things I can comment on right now are the taste and the color and texture.<br /><br />First off, right out of the bucket, this fondant was very stretchy and easy to work with, I pulled out a chunk just to see out it worked, before I ordered more. I found it very nice, and I'm just beginning to work with fondant. I was very concerned with the fact that it was being delivered on a 90 degree day, but it stayed gummy and workable and didn't melt or stick to anything.<br /><br />The color was gorgeous. I was a little worried about it leaving a blue or green color residue or not quite being black, but it's a great color and didn't bleed everywhere.<br /><br />Lastly, the taste, I tried it and I have to say this is some of the best tasting fondant. I liked it so much, that I ordered the white and I plan on making the flowers out of it, because I know people will love them.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br /><br />Worked very well. I made many flowers and other decorations for the cake with this. Everyone thought it tasted great and looked wonderful. My only complaint is that it didn't dry as hard as other products I have used, so I had to be very careful when moving them around as they easily lost shape or fell apart. I'm not sure if this was because of the fondant or because of the heat, even though i made sure they were in a cool, dry place.<br />My other issues is that no matter what I tried, it was very sticky and stuck to the mat that I was rolling it out on. Once I let it sit out for 15min or so, it got much easier to work with and I was able to actually roll and cut ribbons without them breaking or sticking.<br /><br />Overall, I would buy this again, just takes a little bit of getting used to."

In shopping around I have looked for different breakfast cereals I always search for one that is high in fiber without sacrificing loads of flavor. Please note that most of my purchases are for office employee use, since I work roaming construction there are jobs where breakfast options are very limited and products like these come in handy.  In comparison with Special K, Frosted Mini-wheat's, All-Bran, Raisin Bran Crunch, Fiber One, and Grape nuts we have come up with the brands that match our needs. The need is simple, a balance between flavor and fiber. The usual picks that come out on top are Raisin Bran Crunch, Frosted Mini-Wheat's and Kashi Go Lean Crunch. But for as much Fiber (10g) and flavor as Kashi Go Lean crunch had, the 240 Cal/ 3.5g of fat factor was keeping it on edge to being dropped. Thankfully this lighter version made a good impression with only 130 Cal and only 1g of fat but still has 9g of Fiber! Although I will admit I like the flavor of the Crunch more, I have to balance my purchases to a 2 to 1 ratio in favor of the regular Go Lean vs the Go Lean Crunch.

I love Root Beer soda, and was drinking more than I should be, so I figured what did I have to lose? You use 1 drop per each 2 oz of water, so the bottle should last a while. You can also use it to flavor yogurt, and other things as well. Its uses are only limited by your imagination. One other thing I will say is be careful not to overdo it. Using too much could have a bitter result. It also recommends that you refrigerate it after opening so that it lasts longer.

It is rare to find bottled salad dressings made with olive oil, rather than canola oil, soy oil, or safflower oil, which are the three major allergens.  Most people don't even realize they have allergies to these oils, but they could have a stomach ache after eating some.  I bought a number of these bottles when they were on special.  I have noticed that the bottles vary greatly with the amount of green flecks enclosed inside the bottle.  Some have a great deal, and others are almost green-fleck free.  I prefer the bottles with more green flecks, but I'm happy enough with those that have just a few.  Clearly, this is one of the very best commercially prepared salad dressings available.  The front label indicates gluten free/dairy free.  The ingredients are simple enough:  water, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, cider vinegar, salt, xanthan gum, garlic, onion, potassium sorbate (preservative)."

There are also the occasional pieces of fat that I found in one bag.

I've fed my dogs Blue, Iams Naturals, Science Diet, Purina dog chow and numerous others trying to find one that they all will eat. Gravy Train is the only one! It seems Gravy Train really keeps their weight on them, kind of like a maintenience dog food. Once a day I mix in 1/3 of a can of the wet Gravy Train with their food and they always clean their bowls. The only other dog food they've liked as much is the Eukanuba Naturals Turkey and that is expensive and hard to find locally in my area.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend for any dogs.

Did some internet research and found the moths are called Indian Meal Moths.  We have never seen these critters in our kitchen before and are sure they came with the popcorn.  We did a complete clean out of our cupboards and have not found them in any other products.  We wrote an email to Wabash Valley thru Amazon about this incident two weeks ago and have heard nothing back.

It came in a clear plastic bag with the pretty red label.  Very colorful corn - lots of dark red with a few kernels of white mixed in.  As some of the other reviewers have said, for a hot air popper, you'll definitely want to tip the popper backward the minute you plug it in or else the air pressure will send kernels flying around your kitchen like schrapnel.  Trust me - you'll be ducking for cover and then finding kernels for the next year or so.  I did not let go of my hot air popper until there was a good amount of popped corn to weigh down the unpopped kernels.  These kernels are noticeably smaller than others you'll see in the grocery store so when they pop, the end result is smaller.  If you have shag carpet, this is probably not a good thing.  The husks are softer and tend to cause less damage to your gums if they get caughtin your teeth, though it won't happen often.  The cost for this little bag is also significantly higher than we'd want to pay again.  Another big con for us is the number of unpopped kernels that remain - probably 1 - 2 dozen per 1/2 cup batch.

All three dogs thoroughly enjoyed learning to move the individual flaps of the puzzle toy to release one and then both tennis balls, and then moving the center piece to slide up or down, revealing treats! All of the dogs figured the puzzle out within minutes, and each has their own style. My Rott paws it open, bashing it with his giant paws. My Lab nosed it for a while, then picked it up and tossed it. My friend's Terrier mix nosed it open. This is a great way to keep the dogs thinking and to give an outlet for some mental energy. I thought it was flimsy, but so far even with the abuse dished out by close to 200 lbs of dog so far, it only has a few minor scratches, so I would say it is holding up nicely!<br /><br />The bad: the dogs solve it too quickly, and there is no way to make it harder. Additionally, I am not sure how it will hold up in the long term, but I will let you know!<br /><br />Feel free to read the entire review at: [...]"

I got it as a gift for family with two young labs and it was so interesting for all of us to see how interested they were. The more 'biddable' bitch was attracted, but the more 'rambunctious' male stayed nosing and chewing at different angles until he discovered how to lift the cups and get to the treats inside. He quickly became an expert and was easily lifting and dropping the cups, while his friend stayed close and occasionally sneaked a treat out before her could get to it. Don't leave the dogs to play with the cups, or they'll chew them out of shape and they won't lift out as easily. Great fun and gave us a better understanding of the dogs."

The very first time she tried it she cut her mouth on the plastic edges and started bleeding.  I didn't think this would happen as she isn't a large dog with a big snout (30 lb. Cocker Spaniel mix) - her snout is longer and thinner than an average Cocker. It would have helped to know the size of the treat compartments to have an idea of the size before I purchased this. I measured it myself and it is about 1.5"" deep, 2 1/8"" wide and 2 1/4"" long. Seems big enough, but it wasn't. Additionally, only 1 of the 3 yellow compartment covers that are meant to flip up to expose the treat actually stay up long enough to allow a few seconds for the dog to get the treat. The other 2 fall down right away on top of the dog's face which could result in more cuts to the eyes or other parts of the face. I was disappointed because my dog was excited to play and find the treats, but I couldn't let it continue with her being cut. Good game concept, but edges of the toy need to be more smooth and rounded. I am returning this tomorrow."

He is very smart and likes puzzle toys (the ones that conceal treats of course). The problem with this toy is the depth of the 'bowls' that hold the treats. Digby cannot get his snout deep enough into the bowls to get the food. I could see a large dog with a big toungue being able to do it, but not a small dog or a cat. This is too bad because it looks like someone put some thought into this thing, they just perhaps only had one size animal in mind when they designed it. If your pet can lick the inside bottom of a jelly jar, perhaps this will be a good item to get them."

We have several bumble balls and kongs that he loves to play with and thought this treat wheel would be a fun new game for him.  The yellow playing pieces were much too big for him to get his mouth around and he was unable to master using his paws to flip them out of the holders.  For a dog that LOVES any game that involves food, this just proved much too frustrating for him. And believe me, we tried to help our little guy out with this. We left the yellow cups off and just slightly rotated the wheel, but even that was too difficult for him to ""spin"" as it did not move easily.  And it's not like our dog isn't ""Paw-centric"" as he is actually quite adept at using his paws to move and flip his Kong, and to fish treats out from under furniture, etc.  We tried over the course of several weeks to try and help our pal get the hang of this toy, but all parties finally agreed that this just wasn't fun the way a toy should be. Perhaps if you have a bigger dog this will work for you, but it received two paws down from our little buddy.<br /><br />One other concern that I had was the fact that the small hole in the top of the yellow cups seemed just the right opening for a dog to catch a nail in and get stuck on his paw.

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it needs really small bits of food/treats and is not so easy to fill. I end up with quite a bit of food on the floor while trying to fill it.

After this exercise, she was a bit tired from all the mental stimulation, she took a nap for a couple hours. LOL. It was just the right level of difficulty for her. There was a tiny bit of frustration but any more frustration, she would have given up. Now, this is the only way she has dinner. She is getting more and more efficient at removing the cups.

They are hard plastic, but they are fairly thick and don't give even to a hard squeeze. My dogs all realized that the object was to get the covers out of the way, not to chew on them, so that may be the issue. My 4-month-old German Shepherd figured this out very quickly and even put the little covers back on after all the treats were gone, as if she expected them to refill magically, lol! It took my 3-year-old golden retriever a bit more time to figure out and she used her paws quite a bit whereas the puppy was all teeth. It was very interesting to see them try different ways of figuring out the puzzle. However, my 3-year-old malamute is kind of a baby and he tried very briefly before he looked at me and started to whine. Clearly it's not as much fun for a furbaby who is used to having everything handed to him! My girls still get very excited every time we pull this out though. We always use a high value treat in the puzzle, something special that they don't get every day. They will play the game over and over and over as many times as I refill it. I definitely think this is something most dogs can do on their own if you need to keep them busy for 10-15 minutes but my girls seems to enjoy it even more when I'm there cheering them on every time they have a success. The materials are very durable, in my opinion, and clean up couldn't be easier. The holes are very easy to wipe clean and a quick rinse under the faucet for the rest is generally all I need to do for the rest.

We got this toy for him when he was only around 10 weeks old.  It was challenging for him the first time.  When we gave it to him the next day, he knew exactly what he was doing and got all the treats out within two minutes.  We even timed it.  Now, as soon as we set it on the floor, it takes only a few seconds for him to get each compartment open, and we don't give it to him very often.  It's a cute/fun way to deliver some treats, but it's not long before he's looking at us like, ""Okay, now what?  What's next??""<br /><br />Pros: Opens easily so it's not too frustrating.  The star design makes compartments a bit more challenging if the treats are pushed further inside.  You can put a dab of peanut butter in a few, and it will take him longer to lick it out, but you might have to clean it after.  The grips on the underside really help hold it in place so that he doesn't slide it around the floor too far or too quickly. It has withstood his strong bite/chewing. It is rare that he flips it over, too, so it's weighted well.<br /><br />Cons: Too easy, finished with it and bored within a minute, if not a few seconds."

He's definitely food motivated so this was a perfect fit. At first he was laying down while trying to lift up the cups and he couldn't get them up. So i was a little worried they might be a little to smooth for him to lift up but then he stood and gripped the cup in his teeth and pulled it up. He now has the hang of it and can find all the treats in no time. Its great for training (you add the command find it to your routine and it can become a whole new trick/job for your dog). The only down side I can think of is that it's a bit bulky for a toy (you can't just throw it in a dog toy bin) and that it might get old fast for some dogs or owners to use. My other dog is a Amstaff mix and she showed interest in the treats but no desire to search for them lol. So certain breeds may not think this is the bee's knee's.

If the trays were exposed one at a time or randomly. it would increase the dogs playtime and challenge them further.<br /><br />However, my dog does love other Kyjen Toys -- the Tail Teaser,  Egg Babies platypus and Hide-A-Squirrel in the junior size. Based on the great customer service and other toys, i will try some different Kyjen puzzle games instead."

They love their food and tend to inhale it. But they are also very smart and tend to get board. I bought the Star Spinner as well as the paw print shaped toy by this same company and they had a blast from the moment I filled it and set it on the floor! I love that the toys are plastic. So they are much easier to clean (just spray and rinse in the sink, or wipe out with a clorox wipe). Particularly since my corgi prefers soft/moist treats as compared to my dry kibble loving golden. I bought this for roughly $20 at my local canine specialty store, which is far more affordable than the ""name brand"" products. And since I worry about the bacterial growth on the far more expensive wooden models, the easy to clean and disinfect plastic one has been perfect for us. Safety Note: as with ANY dog toy, please supervise your dog while using. Their ""drive"" will be increased while playing with the toy, and with the paw print model with the removable cups, don't let your dog chew on the cups, but redirect him to the treat inside the dish after he pulls out the cup. My golden retriever loves it so much that I now use it to give him his kibble every day! Which is much safer as the bigger dogs tend towards bloat, which can kill your dog. This allows him to have fun while eating tiny amounts of kibble at a time. Win,Win!"

She continued to play with it until see finished her dinner. It took a little time for her to figure out how to remove the pieces without them falling out but she stayed with it so it wasn't frustrating just stimulating. She finished her meal in 20 minutes and then grabbed a chew toy and jumped on the couch. I know Lily likes this toy and so do I. The price makes it extremely likable also. I will point out that Lily thought the yellow pieces were chew toys so I had to take them away when she was done with it. It's a fun quiet meal dispenser
101483,B0081XIAOQ,A11IDK9L74LPT1,C. Schmidt,10,11,2,1336176000,Good idea - implemention flawed. Maybe good for small dogs.,"I recently got this Kyjen Kibble Drop puzzle toy for our two dogs. We have a 65 lb German Shepherd Dog and a 60 lb Golden Retriever. Both have been learning ""nosework"" so I thought this would be a fun toy to add to our scenting games.  I plan to use it by dropping one yummy treat at a time and having them find and get it from one of the 4 cups.<br /><br />I'll give you my conclusion first, and then you can decide if you want to read the details below for more info (including size of the toy info).<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />I don't see how this toy could just be put on the ground and left for your dog to get the food out of the cups. Unless you have a very small dog, your dog's attempts will just move the toy around on the floor.  For larger dogs (like ours) the toy is way too lightweight and the flaps over the cups are too low to the ground for effective ""nosing the flap"" technique. In addition, any dog who couldn't nose the flap effectively would need to use her mouth -- and would naturally pick the arm up in her mouth in an attempt to get at the treats in the cup - thereby dumping all of the treats out of the other cups (hey - problem solved!!!). So, that means to play with this, you'd have to be there to hold the toy down/in-place while your dog does the puzzle and gets the treats.<br /><br />I think this toy would work best (maybe) for a small dog. Kyjen needs to make a heavier and larger sized version for medium or larger dogs.<br /><br />---------<br />.... Now, the details ....<br /><br />First, let me give you some sizing basics about this toy, so you can see if it will be a match for your dog's size.  I measured the toy and it's 10"" wide.  The top of the drop-in treat hole chamber is 4"" high. Each arm sticks out almost 4"" from the middle dispenser. Each treat cup at the end of the arm is about 2""x2"" when you lift the flap.  If you look at the very end of the arm, where the flap shuts, the height of the flap edge from the ground is under 1"".  The arms of the toy obviously slope upwards from the end, so I am talking about the very end of the arm. This is an extremely lightweight plastic toy, weighing in at just 6.2 oz.<br /><br />Whew, now that all the stats are out of the way... how is the actual puzzle toy?<br /><br />Initially, I had all the flaps open and just put a treat in an open cup so they could ""find"" it. They didn't have to open the flaps during that phase. The 2x2"" cup size is just adequate enough for them to get the treat out. If your dog is good at licking a treat out, this small size will work fine. If your dogs likes to mouth the treat out, and you have a larger dog, the 2x2 chamber size will likely be an issue. Our GSD was having trouble getting treats out because of this, although she eventually figured out how to cram her nose in there and use her tongue at the same time. :)  I would imagine a really large dog would have to be pretty good with his tongue to get a treat out of the small cups.<br /><br />An issue that appeared right away even with this simple usage was that the toy is SO lightweight it moves as soon as the dog touches it. I had to hold the toy in place or else they would just push it across the floor while trying to lick the treat out of the (flap open) cup.  I think Kyjen needs to add some weight to help keep this toy from moving so easily. The bottom has little rubber non-skid feet on each arm, but they do nothing.<br /><br />So... moving on to the phase where they had to open the flap to get the treat.... There is an issue here. For larger dogs, the flap is so low to the ground, that they can have trouble nosing it up. Our Golden tends to lie in front of what she ""finds"" when scenting. So, her head was already down on the ground level, which made it easier to work on flipping open the very-low-to-the-ground flap. Our GSD stays standing, though. So, from that angle, she couldn't really use her nose to flip the flap up (although she tried). She also used her mouth to try and open it, pawed at it, etc. I'm sure if I wasn't there to hold the toy from sliding, she would have just picked the whole thing up in her mouth -- problem solved! :)<br /><br />Now you can see why I wrote my summary above. From my experience, this is just the wrong size/weight toy for our dogs. I'll still use it for scent games, because I only need to drop one piece at a time in and I can hold the toy in place for this. But I am not sure how else this toy could be used unless you have a small dog.<br /><br />This is a hard toy to rate because of these issues. It's a good idea, but the implementation is flawed. Which is why I rated it so low.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />c-"
101484,B0081XIAOQ,A1ECAJB5FFKK5O,Lynn Katz,5,5,5,1318896000,Very cool,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:34 Mins<br /><br /></span>My dog can get bored easily and when he's bored he's destructive and annoying.  So I try to find anything I can to keep his mind busy and hopefully wear him out.  He figured this toy out fast and gets his food in about 2 minutes, but he does really love it and he often settles down after playing with it.  My other dog (the chi x you see in the picture) has absolutely no interest in working for his food. So I guess it's not for all dogs, but if your dog is busy, this is a good way to occupy him for awhile."

He loves finding stuff in the little cups, however the yellow covers are impossible for him to get off. His mouth won't fit around them so he can't pick them up with his teeth, when he uses his nose to try to get at them the cups just fall back into place and if he uses his paws (that's when he's really frustrated) he winds up just flipping the whole thing over. I have turned the cups upside down so that he can grab at the edges and that works for him. However, it's not really a puzzle because he even figured out that if the cup is sticking up, something is in there. I even have a hard time getting some of the cups out because of the way it is shaped. It's not a bad toy as a starter puzzle but if your dog has done puzzles before, this one won't keep him interested. And if you have a dog with no snout, it's not really worth it."

Then he gets his jaws around the cover and tries to pull it off, sometimes not on the first attempt.  He goes around until he has pulled off each cover that holds a treat.

So why do I give it 5 stars?  Well, challenging or not, this toy keeps my dog engaged and happy while eating!<br /><br />When my husband and I adopted our little dachshund/miniature schnauzer mix, he wasn't eating very much.  The vet told us that once he acclimated to his new owners and surroundings, his appetite would pick up.  Well, it didn't.  After two months, he still would not eat very much out of his bowl.  He would take 3-4 bites and would walk away from all his food.  My husband and I had to force our dog to eat or hand feed him - neither of which we liked.<br /><br />I read up on dachshunds and found out that they are hunting dogs.  I thought that maybe if we made getting his meal a bit more of a hunt or challenge that he would like it more - and sure enough, I was right!  Ever since we bought this star toy, he eats ALL his food with no problems!  It is such a relief not to have force or hand feed our dog and to not worry if our dog is getting enough food.  The fact that he enjoys it and likes it so much is just the icing on the cake and makes us so happy!  So, for our dog, it's more of an interactive feeder than a toy or brain game but we feel that it was well worth the money paid!<br /><br />We've had it about a month now and our dog eats out of it 1-2 times a day and it's holding up just fine.

This is my second product with them and will most likely be my last as the other one had some design flaws as well. Overall, the concepts seem to be good, but there's always one glaring flaw and cheap materials/construction. This treat wheel is a good idea: pull out the ""pegs"" and find the treat then use your nose to push the wheel around until you find a secondary treat in another chamber. However, the execution is anything but good. First, the pegs are in too deep and with little (except a dangerously small hole to snag a nail) to grip except super slippery plastic. I tried myself to push and pull the item out of place, and it wouldn't budge (not surprising since 3/4 of it is ""buried"") and my dogs just grew frustrated and quit. I thought of using it without the pegs and just as a spinner but all the chambers are connected, and the top portion is so badly attached to the bottom that it wobbles about instead of spinning smoothly around. Plus, the chambers are so slick (all the toy being made of that same super slippery plastic) that the treat just slides around. And forget durability. I've seen Dollar Store toys constructed better. A medium to large dog could break this thing in one sitting."

I suggest this technique if this puzzle is too challenging for your dog; at least till they figure out how to successfully pull the piece off when turned the right way.<br /><br />The Non-skid pads on bottom is an amazing feature. I guess the makers knew mischievous dogs would push the entire toy around as an additional part of the game lol. Its base material is plastic which is perfect for washing.

I purchased both Kyjen's Triad and their Jigsaw Glider. My pooch went right for both, and my only (minor) complaint is that they're TOO easy.<br /><br />Forrest has mastered other treat toys, including the Aikou (done in under two minutes), and Nina Ottosson's Dog Magic and Tornado. With the Triad, he had the ""spin"" and ""flip"" mechanisms figured out in a few minutes. Keeping the flip doors open long enough to detract the treat, however, seemed to require some skill and practice. Not generally a ""cheater"", he finally resorted to flipping the whole unit upside down, to discover that doesn't work very well either, unless he kept rolling it over and over repeatedly. He did (during the initial test drive) get the hang of flipping the flap and keeping it up long enough to get his hard-fought reward. I may make mention that he has a long, narrow snout, and the patience of a saint once his tongue makes physical contact with food stuffs. A friend of mine has a young Border Collie/Karelian Bear Dog cross who is still figuring out all the parts to the Magic, so these Kyjen toys would be appropriate for him, as well as any dog just becoming familiar to puzzle toys, and learning how they work. It's also worth a mention that if you're not willing to sacrifice peace and quiet for your dog's amusement, do not purchase. Nor if you have squeaky-wheel neighbors living below your hard wood floors... unless they're out of town.<br /><br />My terrier has a short attention span, in that if it's TOO hard, he loses interest after a while. Not one for extreme challenges. Nina Ottosson's Twister is still a ""project in the works"", and not one I would recommend for first-timers and beginners.

I let them play with the squeaky squirrel for a few minutes, then put it back in and say, ""Go find"".  They love it, and will throw the ""stump"" around and thrash it back and forth, extending the game.<br /><br />While the toy is very durable, it is suitable only for observed play, as the chewy rubber of the exterior could be ingested.

This smacks of the worst kind of marketing, taking advantage of the organic label and the potential health benefits but selling it in inferior packaging, legal yes, but not really in the spirit of the organic movement. For Pete's sake the lid itself has the word ""organic"" written on it 6 times!

I feel that this company is taking advantage of customers and deceiving mothers & fathers who are trying to do the best by buying organic food for their babies.  The company will not answer questions directly online or on their FaceBook accounts.  They give you the runaround to call their customer service number.  However, when they do finally admit to BPA being in the lid of the products, they try to pass it off as being an ""industry standard"" and that the food is ""Safe.""  Well, for those of us who are concerned enough to purchase organic foods--I think we want to see NO BPA in the packaging or product.  I am not content to be told what is safe or acceptable for my baby by a company's marketing department.  So, I have decided that, even though my baby has enjoyed Earth's Best products, I will find other products that do not have BPA in their packaging or food items.  I am truly disappointed that this huge manufacturer of ""organic"" products is allowing a product that has been banned in baby bottles in Europe to be in the lids of food jars in the United States.

101568,B001BM368E,A8PP8NPRJSAKO,Brazilian Jazzaholic!,3,3,2,1321833600,Jar lids contain BPA ... So disappointing!,"As my baby approaches the stage at which we can introduce solids to her diet, I started doing my research on organic, prepared baby foods.  I was all set to make Earth's Best my brand of choice, since we already use some of their other products (e.g., baby wipes).  But that was until I discovered that the covers of their glass jars contain bisphenol-A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor that can cause negative health effects, especially in vulnerable infants and young children.  Apparently, Earth's Best claims that its jarred baby food has been independently-tested, and found to have undetectable levels of BPA.  However, I'm still skeptical.  In a ""perfect lab"" setting with a pristine jar of baby food, the BPA may not have had the opportunity to leach from the cover into the baby food.  But in the real world, by the time that jar of baby food reaches the average consumer, it has been turned upside-down and shaken up in the process of packing, shipping, unpacking, shelving, etc.  Plus, many parents warm up their baby food in the jars; and I've heard that heating can increase/speed-up the BPA leaching process.  SCARY STUFF!!  I don't see why Earth's Best doesn't just play it safe and line their baby food jar covers with a resin that doesn't contain BPA.  It's honestly not that hard to do ... Just ask Eden Organics!  The linings of many of their canned vegetables are BPA-free.  Sure, it might increase the cost of the baby food by a bit, but I'm sure I speak for many parents when I say that I'd be willing to pay a little extra just for the peace of mind of knowing that there are no harmful chemicals in my baby's food.  After all, we're willing to spend a bit more for organic baby food to begin with.<br /><br />Earth's Best also makes baby food in BPA-free pouches.  But, to be honest, the company's refusal to acknowledge and correct the problem of BPA in its jar covers has left me with a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended).  So I may just take my ""baby-food-business"" elsewhere."

The lids of all their jars have BPA in them. I contacted their customer service department and was told that it doesn't come in contact with the food as long as the lid isn't heated. But how do we control how hot the jars get while in transit to the store? So disappointing.

That is why I am buying organic food and I do my best to prepare fresh food for her when I can. I am so disappointed to know for a company labeling organic containing ''bpa '' in their lids. what is the point??<br /><br />I spend considerable amount of money and effort to make sure my baby is not consuming toxins. I buy bpa free bottles, I even called similac feeding line to make sure formula containers did not have bpa- which they dont and I go buy a organic food with bpa lids. I am higly disapponted by earths best insensitivity to this matter. I personally feeled tricked. I trusted this company since I saw their food were in glass jars.<br /><br />I wanted to take this time to write this review. here is some facts about BPA---<br />The chemical is bisphenol A, or BPA, a component of the plastic epoxy resins used to line metal food cans. Dozens of laboratory studies show that BPA affects the developing brain and reproductive systems of animals exposed to low doses during pregnancy and early life. BPA has recently raised concerns from 2 separate expert panels of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), with 1 group of scientists warning that human exposures to BPA are already at or above the levels that harm animals and another expressing concern about impacts of BPA on infants' brains and behavior."

I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal.

As it turns out my daughter can't stand peas and the nice thing is we only have 2 jars left over instead of quite a bit more potentially. It's pretty basic and on a whole I think most babies like all of these, but you just never know. That's why I like it in this kit. You can try them out without having to hand pick and sort through a bunch at the store. It takes the guessing out of it.

We tried the carrots and my baby loved it so much he finished about 3/4th of the 2 oz jar. However carrots are constipating and I had to give him 6 oz of apple juice mixed with water a day to relieve the constipation. Lesson learnt- when introducing new foods-especially rice cereal, not very ripe bananas and carrots, start with only about a tablespoon and then move up slowly.According to what it says on the jar, once opened it can be stored in the fridge for 3 days.<br />I like that Earth's best is supposed to be organic and not genetically modified food.

Their numerous choices have provided a needed variety in my often soup-centric meals.  Some of their soups have a light broth, some are thicker, and some verge on being very stew-like.  However, lately I've noticed a marked tendency toward watering down their previously thicker soups such as Lentil and Beef Pot Roast.  Their Three-Bean Chili with Beef was created in this vein and the tomato-flavored broth is thin and watery.  In order to compensate, Progresso seems to have decided to overuse chili powder in any soup which has been tagged as Mexican or Southwestern in origin.  Thus, the sole flavor one was able to taste in this particular soup was chili powder.<br /><br />On the positive side, the beans are plentiful and well-cooked.  The beef was not fatty or grittle-laden, although it was not plentiful in the can I cooked.  There were a number of small tomato pieces and a bit of what appeared to be jalapeno peppers.  It would have been wonderful if these flavors had been melded into a more balanced tasting soup.<br /><br />It is because of Progresso's current overuse of chili powder - perhaps to mask the inadequacies in their newer soups - that I have rated this soup as a three-star product."

101697,B001RICWAA,A6GMEO3VRY51S,microjoe,1,1,5,1294272000,Made in Michigan since 1866,"I like ""Vernor's"", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is ""The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now"" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans."

Practically, everything that you would see a cat eat in the wild is in the food. There is real meat and fish in there, blueberries, cranberries and vegetables as well. I noticed a HUGE change in my cat. She used to be real lethargic, always laying around sleeping, taking a few practice jumps before jumping up on the couch. Not to mention she had very bad dandruff. She's a tortoise shell and you could clearly see the dandruff without being right on top of her. Once I switched to Blue Buffalo, she got a little pep in her step. Now I find her running around the house like a bat out of hell and neither of my other two cats know what the heck is going on. Her coat is also nice, shiny and dandruff free. I never knew how much of a difference the change in food could be for her. Now she jumps up on the couch and bed (which is higher up) with ease and is even initiating play with my other two cats. I hate to sound mushy but considering that changing food was the only thing we did different with her, Blue Buffalo gave me my childhood friend back.<br /><br />It may be more expensive than your average cat food but it is well worth it in the end. I do mix longevity with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UT92EY"">Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Cat Food, Chicken Recipe, 12-Pound Bag</a> and have had no problem with her not eating it.

After sampling all the bold brew T-Discs available, and prior to the release of Starbuck's Africa Kitamu, I was a faithful user of their Verona discs. That all changed with my first sip of the Africa Kitamu coffee. The strength is decidedly bold but not bitter. The best description may be that it is very smooth. It is absolutely delicious, and Africa is now my first choice and new favorite.<br /><br />The coffee is also a wise choice for those who like a lighter brew. Simply use the manual override procedure on the Tassimo coffee maker to add extra water to taste. In the process, an even larger cup of coffee is created.<br /><br />With each new release, Starbucks's has added significant quality to the T-Disc line and is quickly making my Tassimo indispensable."

I like a bold coffee for my first cup of the day and my old favorite, Verona, was terrific. I just hoped I would like the Kitamu enough that I wouldn't have to throw it away. I was hooked from the first sip. The Kitamu is much bolder than the Verona and has a great aroma, and the flavor of the roast really comes through. If you favor breakfast blends and other mild coffees, pass on this one. If you're a fan of Verona and have not tried the Kitamu, give it a spin. You might find a new first cup, too."

For those like me who count pennies, the best Amazon deal is usually sold in 2 packs of 12 = 24 T-disks, thus about 90 cents per cup, with free shipping.  A slight bit cheaper even with tax if you can find it on the shelves at BB&B, especially with one of their coupons.<br /><br />Closest I've had to a cup purchased from a Starbucks counter.

I'm comparing the two products to each other because they look so similar in color, size, shape. But my dog will tell you that the texture is definitely different. The Zoe appears tougher and chewier. It last minutes longer than the Dentastix per serving. My dog will sit and take his time to chew through the Zoe chew stix, which I like. Compared to the Pedigree stuff I get from my local Target which seems to disappear in his mouth and he's begging again after just a few seconds. The manufacturer's feeding directions says to feed two sticks a day. The calorie count is 90 per stick. I can't recommend that to your pet. I'm going to give this as a once a week treat, alternating with other stuff since my cocker is prone to getting fat. Unlike Dentastix, this does not indicate any dental health benefits. Still, this is made of quinoa and is gluten free, in case you care about that stuff. Cute packaging and is conveniently resealable. I would buy again and recommend to others.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have bought this again since my dog loves it so much. The second package I got, I actually decided to count houw many sticks came in one bag. There are only 6 if you get the large size like I do. 6 stick for $6. They tell you to give one or two sticks a day. Nevermind the calories (90 per stick)... but one bag might not even last you a week if you follow manufacturer's directions. Kind of pricey at $1 per stick. Greenies on Amazon (regular size) are less expensive. Anyway, I still think that this is a great product and I would still buy it... but believe me, I will be buying less often and only give it to my dogs on special ocassions!"

I definitely will not be feeding this to him again.  It is too bad also since this looked to be a great treat, I looked at the ingredient list and did some research on all the ingredients and the only one that can cause an allergy is carrageenan, which is the vegetarian equivalent of casein, used as filler.  It is a natural ingredient derived from seaweed, but is said to cause digestive problems.  Most doggie treats do not contain carrageenan so this is the only ingredient that may have caused a reaction in my dog.

My thought with these sticks was that if I cut a little off one end, it would be a perfect fit for the everlasting ball.  It turns out, they are hard as a rock!  I tried a couple of different knives and even my meat cleaver, but none of them made any headway in cutting off the 2"" I needed to remove.  Then I picked it up and tried to break it with my hands, and it snapped in two right on the line I had been trying to cut (perhaps I scored it a little).  Anyway, it turns out that is the secret to these things - breaking instead of cutting.<br /><br />I am not in the least concerned about the caloric value of them so that was not figured into my perception of the treats in any way.  One of my dogs is slender - the other downright skinny (has a high metabolism and is offered plenty to eat but never finishes a meal).  The older, slender dog got the 2"" bit I cut off and the younger skinny dog got the remainder of the stick in her everlasting ball.  May not be fair but she had to work harder to get it so it all comes out in the wash.<br /><br />The older dog practically took my hand off to get to the treat quickly.  Once she had it, she ran off and put it back on the floor so she could take her time with it.  I will say that the little 2"" stick lasted her much longer than I would have expected so I rate them high for that reason.  The chewing action is good for their teeth/jaws and is far preferable to a treat they gobble down without tasting.<br /><br />The younger dog went racing after her everlasting ball and stayed busy for a long time trying to get it out.  I wasn't around when she finally succeeded to know how long it took her to eat it but am glad it kept her interested for awhile.<br /><br />The packaging is cute and the bag is resealable.

Again Boston had no problem managing the product in a safe manner.  I gave Hunter the stick but retained control of one end so he could not gulp it whole.  He began to chew off a piece, and did eat the product safely.  I inspected Boston's teeth after he finished his portion and was pleased that there seemed to be some lessening in the tarter buildup on the back teeth.<br /><br />Both of my dogs liked the product, although to be fair neither is very picky.  I also offered the product to two other dogs, a 50 lib mixed breed who managed it quite readily and a 10 lb Yorkie who chewed it a bit and then buried it.  I am concerned that a larger, greedy dog like Hunter could choke on this.<br /><br />I like that the product is low calorie but I think that at nearly a dollar a stick it is a bit pricey.  I like that the sticks are hard enough to make the dogs chew.  Boston did seem to get some teeth cleaning benefits from the product.  Unfortunately due to the high price and the safety issues for Hunter I probably will not be purchasing this again."

I was was ready to say she didn't like them, but, when I gave the stick back to her during her brushing(I have give her something to chew on so she doesn't chew on me), she gobbled it up, and in fact, it took 3 sticks to get through her half hour brush-out(she's a rough collie, like Lassie).<br /><br />Though  Zoe treats are low calorie, something my dog doesn't have to worry about, they still apparently taste good.

Even though these contain chicken and natural chicken flavor they smell like cinnamon and nutmeg. I assumed he would turn up his nose. I set a treat stick at his feet. He ignored it for several minutes so I figured that was that. When I turned my back he started eagerly chewing on it. He devoured it. He begged for more. He loved it! Hey Pep&eacute;! Pep&eacute; is my 2-year old Chihuahua/mini-dachshund. He'll eat anything. I cut one in half for him. He was thrilled. He also loved it. But I knew he would.<br /><br />These treat sticks contain really healthy ingredients like brown rice flour, organic quinoa flour, oat fiber and oat groats. I had to look up FOS - aka fructooligosaccharide. It's a probiotic, which is great. However FOS can cause gas, bloating, and intestinal discomfort. So I recommend one treat per day for large dogs and one half per day for small dogs.

These sticks were a hit.  They are similar to Pedigree Dentastix, but I think these last longer.  The 6 sticks are each about 5 inches long and the cinnamon flavor actually smelled pretty good.  The packaging says gluten-free, low calorie, and high protein grain for excellent source of energy.  Our Basset Hound, who usually inhales her treats, actually took some time to get through hers.  Our Rat Terrier chewed hers in great gusto.  She's a bit overweight right now, so it was encouraging to find a ""low calorie"" treat.  We have a visiting Springer Spaniel and she enjoyed the odd treat to her normal rawhide chips.  I did not give it to my older Beagle as she is on a ""low protein"" diet and the packaging says ""high protein"".  As the dogs ate them, there were a few that broke off larger pieces to work on.  I wondered if I could break a stick in 1/2 for the smaller dog, but they do not break, or even bend.  They are not greasy and the packaging has a re-sealable zip top for easy storage.  Overall, the dogs really enjoyed the Zoe Chew Sticks and I enjoyed the fact that the sticks seem to be a fairly healthy alternative to raw hide chews."

Dogs will eat just about anything, except for broccoli and carrots with my baby Jilly, and to get some item when you are paying mostly for either package design or brand name isn't something I buy into being that stuff impresses me, not her.  That being said I did like this product and more importantly Jilly loved it.  These have the same X shape as a dentastix, so I have to assume it would help getting rid of some plaque buildup, although there are no claims on the package.  The cinnamon and spice flavor was potent enough that I could smell it when I opened the package, which I liked, being I knew what she is getting.  And even though the flavor might be more for me than for Jilly, it sure is an improvement over liver flavors etc.<br /><br />Compared to similar products this was harder and took her more time to eat, which I liked.  It took her about 8-10 minutes and a lot of similar type products she eats in just a few minutes.  All that being said, I really did enjoy the product for what it was, but I am not so sure about any weight loss or health benefits.  The L-Carnitine proudly displayed on the front of the package, right next to the antioxidants came off as something like lycopene does for people.  Sure it's good for you and you should eat more of it but when you do do you honestly notice a difference in the way you feel?  As to the weight loss aspects, my dog is only about 8 months old and she's normal weight, but a bit husky being she's a lab. She has some small milk dud sized treats that are her absolute favorites that are 3 calories each and a handful would have less calories than this bone, if weight was an issue and Jilly prefers a natural bone (real bone not rawhide) and it takes her a LONG time to eat and I can't believe the amount of calories she gets per preserving is more than 92.<br /><br />Basically, for what it is it's a very good product, that being said there are most likely better options out there if you aren't willing to spend money on the nice smell and nice packaging.  I'm not sure if I would order it again, but maybe being I like to give her a verity in treats being she eats the same old same old kibble.<br /><br />4 1/2 stars."

Unfortunately rice based products tend to crumble and these cookies are no exception.  Mine were purchased locally and one third were broken.  It is possible that better packing would reduce breakage as the current packing does not restrict movement of the cookies. Worse, this packing does nothing to distribute G forces evenly across each cookie when the box is dropped.  Old style cookie tins have crinkled paper cups and shock absorbing corrugated cardboard.  Pamela needs to take advantage of our ever expanding knowledge of the physics of how things break.  Put another way, Pamela,s package is like a car with no seat belts, no airbags, no safety cage and no crumple zone. Additional cost would be small in my opinion.<br /><br />Rice cookies made with honey or molasses hold up better as these sticky sweeteners have gluten's glue like binding power.  It may not be possible to make shortbread cookies more durable while maintaining the excellent taste.<br /><br />I cannot eat real shortbread so breakage is better than nothing."

I found out that the majority of tuna makers started using a variety of Tuna called ""Skip Jack"".<br />They're still tuna but much smaller and less expensive.<br />That's why tuna looks like cat food nowadays.<br />If you want the good stuff, you have to get the solid chunk tuna.<br />It's more expensive but it's worth it.<br />Then one fine day I saw the Bumblebee Thai and figured it would taste like spicy cat food.<br />Man was I WRONG!!!<br />I went from a tuna lover to a tuna hater and back again.<br />This tuna is the ultimate treat.<br />It's spicy but not overly hot.<br />It's simply delicious in salad.<br />It's probably the only tuna I can literally eat right out of the can.<br />I cannot rave enough about this particular brand of tuna.<br />Spicy<br />Delicious<br />A home run for Bumblebee.<br />Highly recommended."

Burn your hand? Break off a bit of the aloe plant. Stomach ache? A soothing tea made of sarsaparilla root (which is apparently kinda dangerous...oops). My minor in college was Folklore, and I love this kind of stuff, different plants that supposedly help with different aches...I've seen it firsthand in my wife. She gets crazy bad migraines, and a good cup of mint tea can help her keep things under control. But I love the Red Leaf Teas website, especially their matchas, that list everything the plant involved in the flavoring can do. Take this tea for instance:<br /><br />Did you know that studies showed that pomegranate juice destroys breast cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone? It may also prevent breast cancer cells from forming.<br />Pomegranates also offer the following benefits to list a few :<br />Lung Cancer Prevention<br />Slows Prostate Cancer<br />Keeps PSA Levels Stable<br />Protects the Neonatal Brain<br />Prevention of Osteoarthritis<br />Protects the Arteries<br />Alzheimer's Disease Prevention<br />Lowers Cholesterol<br />Lowers Blood Pressure<br />Dental Protection<br />taken from the Red Leaf Teas website.<br /><br />Now, part of me just brushes most of that off, but the part of me that is my mother's hippie daughter drinks this matcha just in case. My aunt recently started chemo to deal with her breast cancer, and one of the things that helped speed up the end of my grandmother's life was breast cancer, so I don't mess around with it. If there's even a slight possibility something might help prevent breast cancer in my body, I'm there. I've already had that scare once, so it's not something I take lightly. And pomegranates are just a good idea all around. If I can get that great, juicy pomegranate flavor without having to deal with the hassle of getting in to an actual pomegranate, even better.<br /><br />The smell is wonderful. Nice and strong and juicy, I can already taste the delicious smoothies that will come from this. But I'm moving away from the smoothies more and more, as I used to think the only way I would enjoy matcha would be in a smoothie and I have since learned that that is decidedly not true. I'm on my third cup today!<br /><br />I don't know how to describe the taste other than juicy, which I feel like I've been using too much lately. But it's true! All of the fruit blends I've had from Red Leaf Tea have been juicy! This one especially...and I can just see a Matcha Pomtini in my future. Or mix this with a little orange juice? Yum. This tea is definitely one I want to spend a bit of quality time with."

While Amazon sells papad by Lijjat for a very reasonable price, that product, like most papad, needs to be fried or toasted.  This product allows for quick, immediate consumption with your favorite chutney (I really like Swad's chutney, particularly the mint).  The poppadums in the container are quite small -- about the size of a half dollar coin.  While small, each has a nice satisfying crunch.  Truly Indian makes several different poppadum flavors but the Lentil with Cumin is my favorite.<br /><br />As a product of India, you can expect to pay a premium.  I first bought a containers of these from my local Meijer and they were around 5 dollars.  So, with Amazon's subscribe and save, you are getting a fairly good deal.

Some people use red or rice vinegar in combination to water to cut the heat, or even soy sauce. Please note* a little goes a long way as this is Hot mustard. The heat is not like a chili pepper at all. It is reminiscent to a horseradish heat that comes on strong and instant, but also dissipates just as fast.  This does have a slight bitter after-taste when the heat dissapates. I have found mixing in a small amount of prepared Dijon makes this a smoother product, and less acrid.  It also is a bit grainy straight out of the can mixed/prepared. I only use one Tablespoon of dry mustard at a time with 1 Tablespoon of prepared.

He always analyzes his food visually and won't let us pry open his mouth if it doesn't pass inspection.  But he willingly tasted this before he saw the green puree and was instantly sold!  I suspect he likes the cool delivery system. I'm checking with the manufacturer to see if it really is 120% DV for iron, or if it's a misprint.<br /><br />*** Update!  Yes, Ella's reports that it was a misprint and the company is working hard to fix the problem.  4% is the actual number.  That fits more with spinach's DV's.  Only way to get that high is to add iron supplements!  Glad I checked.  Got a quick and honest answer from them.  Hope they are able to fix labeling issues soon.

I am so tired of things being labeled as something else being mostly applesauce!  It's good for on the go, but if you're not careful, it will make a mess.

If s/he will eat applesauce, there's no reason not to throw some veggies in with the applesauce pack!"
101932,B0031UBXDE,AYDJ2KW8DWNCJ,dameshe,0,1,4,1336608000,So far she likes it!,"I can hardly contain my excitement so I had to post a review. My baby is almost 17 months old. When she first started solids at around 6 months, she was adventurous and tried and ate everything, including a great amount of veggies. When she turned a year old, she got really fussy and turned her little nose up at every single veggie we tried to give her. She would only eat fruit and yogurt with her cereal in the morning and for the rest of the day she would only accept meat. This has been going on for so long now that I began to get really really worried that she wasn't getting enough good nutrition. I had seen Ella's pouches, but hadn't tried them. A friend highly recommended them to us this weekend so I figured we should try it. I decided to go full on veggie and try this flavor (spinach, apple, rutabaga), and just give them away if she really hated it.<br /><br />Ok, so I'm only giving it 4 stars just in case things change, BUT i tasted one just now and thought, yuck, ok, this is REALLY strongly spinach flavored, she is NOT going to eat this, but I gave her the pouch and she gobbled it DOWN! She was still trying to get some out of the empty pouch! I can't believe it. I'm a very pleased mama. My fussy baby ate spinach, woohoo! :)<br /><br />I'll see how things go over the next few pouches, but so far I recommend them for fussy eaters. If she continues to like this one, I will try a few more. Thanks Ella's kitchen!"

Hmm.. no announcement there stating that an error had been made. So, I contacted the company wondering if it was a misunderstanding. No, it's true. The Spinach flavor only has 4-6% DV of Iron... NOT 120% as has been clearly indicated on the pouches I have been buying for my son for OVER A YEAR! I have been purchasing these packs by the case thinking that if my son did not eat enough other Fe-rich foods on a particular day, at least he would eat this. I mean you know how difficult it can be to get little ones to take in enough iron, so I thought this was a great option. IF I HAD KNOWN that it only contained 4 or 6%, then I would have given my son other additional Fe-rich foods or continued making my own purees. I guess I should have known it was too good to be true when I noticed that the first ingredient is in fact APPLES not Spinach as the front of the pouches would have you believe.<br /><br />What upsets me the most is that there is not even a warning or announcement on Amazon or at Target stores stating that there has been a mistake?!! If the company knows, why isn't this info passed on to the consumer?!!? Here I thought I was purchasing (a more expensive) but also more nutritionally complete product for my baby and to find out it's just as void of nutrients as all of the other brands on the shelves. I really thought this company was exciting and different and focused on kids' nutrition and health. I guess not. I am asking for a refund at the very least. Honestly, the company is lucky if parents don't decide to take up a lawsuit for their negligence in getting the word out. The incorrectly labeled packs should be recalled like anything else- not left on the shelves to trick parents! Normally, I am not one to overact and am certainly not litigious in the least. Humans (and companies run by humans) make mistakes. It's natural. But as a physcian and a mother, I am really annoyed by the lack of respect shown to consumers in failing to notify the community of this error."

Since we moved after the birth of my second child, we aren't able to get a nice fresh variety of organic fruits and veggies like we used to, so I decided to try buying organic baby food instead. My kids love these pouches (give or take a few of the flavors). I love the pouch packaging for easy clean-up, compact travel and not having to worry about carrying glass jars around.<br /><br />Both my infant (9 months old) and toddler (2.5 years old) love this flavor of Ella's the best, much to our surprise.  I think it's probably b/c it one of the few foods without bananas added.  It is a bit runny, so keep that in mind when using a spoon to feed.  But since it's so runny, it's good for younger ones that aren't used to thicker solids.<br /><br />The Spinach, Peas and Pears from Plum Organics is similar in taste, but is a little thicker, if the consistency of this one isn't right for you.  Also, we often mix this with some rice cereal to thicken it up if needed.<br /><br />I would recommend buying the variety pack to see which ones your kids might like.  Also, if they don't like it at first, don't give up, give them some time and try it again later.  They might change their minds."

Sure with sales tax here in Chicago that turns out to be about $1.30 per pouch, but still quite a bit less than the $4+ that this merchant is charging.<br /><br />In short, if you are thinking about getting this product, do so!

I was really surprised to see a fruit product like this one had so much calcium (10%) on the package compared to most of the other baby fruits out there (usually 0-2% unless veggies or yogurt's added in) and chose this over other products, thinking the extra calcium would be worth the extra $ for my baby in the long run. When you check it against Ella's website, it HAS NO CALCIUM%! Same goes for all the other stage 1 Ella's fruits (butternut squash, carrots, apples, prunes: 30% calcium on package but 2% on the website, carrots, apples, parsnips 30% calcium on package vs. 0% on website all the same serving size) -- there were other differences too in protein, iron, etc. It does cost a lot more than some of the other organic baby fruits out there and tastes awful. If your baby is just as content with the other less expensive organic baby fruits out there, go with the cheaper alternative because nutrition wise, Ella's no better!<br /><br />What a disgusting marketing ploy by Ella's Kitchen to get parents to choose their products because it is falsely more nutritious when it's the same as other organic baby fruits in terms of nutritional value."

I have tried these and they are very tasty, which I was surprised because some of the combos don't sound like they would taste good (spinach, apple, rutabaga?). I am from Dallas and I get them from a grocery store here called Central Market and they normally sell them at less than $2 but will have sales where you can get them at around $1, so that is when I stock up.

We chose to add alfalfa into our products because of all the amazing benefits from it. We harvest the alfalfa leaves for our greens. Alfalfa is one of the world's deepest roots plants absorbs many trace minerals and nutrients from the soil. It's root structure that can grow up to 20 ft. deep, letting it absorb minerals in the sub-soil that many plants can never reach. It also contains all essential amino acids and is a great source of Vitamins A, D E and K. The alfalfa leaf also contains:<br /><br />. Calcium- bone and tooth formation, muscle contractions, heartbeat.<br />. Phosphorus- needed for normal bone and tooth structure. Interrelated<br />with action of calcium and Vitamin D. Improves nourishment of nerve and tissue.<br />. Silicon Magnesium- constipation, steadies the nerves, has protective<br />effect on skin and body, stimulates brain function<br /><br />To add to that, we don't produce or incorporate ANY alfalfa seeds or sprouts into our products.  The negative info you've likely seen only refers to the seeds or sprouts.  Whole Leaf alfalfa has long been revered for it's incredible green leafy vegetable properties and incredible trace minerals.  There isn't any controversy about it that I've ever heard of."

The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S"">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.

What I do is first preheat the oven to 400 degrees and then spread about 4-6 tablespoons or so of peanut oil on a release foil lined cookie sheet, with low sides. Then wet and bread chicken with Sylvia's mix according to package directions. (I don't always use the egg though.) Place skin side of chicken pieces down onto the oiled cookie sheet and bake in oven for 30 minutes. Then turn chicken over and bake for another 30 minutes or until done. It tastes just as great as the deep fried, but without the added grease and mess. Easy cleanup and oh, so good!<br /><br />I won't use any other chicken breading except Sylvia's."

You use this instead of going out to the market looking for whole spices.  Each box contains 4 spice pouches (basically big tea bags).  You use it by cooking up some plain chicken broth or stock and adding the tea bag to the cooking broth.  After it's steeped for a while you can taste to see if the spice is strong enough for you, if not, leave it in longer.  Once you're done with it, you just remove it from the broth.  I like it much better than the powdered mixes, because I find that they are usually much too sweet and/or salty for my taste without providing enough spice.  It also allows you to control how weak or strong of broth you use.  I really liked the pho broth that resulted from this and highly recommend it."

102141,B001ELLB16,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,D. Blankenship,31,34,5,1249689600,GOOD SERVICEABLE OIL AT AN ATTRACTIVE PRICE.  I LIKE THIS STUFF.,"I first purchased Colavita oil a few years ago out of pure desperation and lucky.  Ever have one of those days when nothing goes right?  Well my wife and I were having one of those at the time.  We had guests coming over for dinner, things were running late and as is our luck, we found we were completely out of olive oil.  We use olive oil a lot, but it was an odd occurrence.  Anyway, I rushed to a local grocery story...we were living in Virginia at the time, and being in a bit of a hurry, I grabbed the first can I came to.  This happened to be Colavita.  This was a very lucky break on my part.<br /><br />Now I cannot look you in the eye and tell you that this oil in anyway is as good as some of the premium oils we have used in the past and still use.  But what I can tell you is that for oil that is classified as a ""grocery store oil,"" this is very nice stuff.  We still use it.  Now there are certain considerations to be noted here.  I have looked over some of the reviews and feel a need to have my little say.<br /><br />First, any olive oil that is old will taste rancid and simply will not cook well.  The same hold true for an oil that is not stored correctly.  If you use a lot of olive oil in your cooking, then you should buy a lot.  If you use it less often, then buying in bulk, or in a large amount is a sheer waste of money. This stuff will go bad on you quicker than you think.  And for goodness sakes don't store it in a clear container...that is not a good idea!<br /><br />Secondly, I noted that Cook's Illustrated recently proclaimed that ""all supermarket brands"" of olive oil where horrid.  While there may be some truth to this on some level, I must admit when I saw this, the first thing that flashed through my mind was ""Aaaah, snob patrol in action again, slamming it to the unwashed masses.""  Personally I put about as much validity in this type of report as I did in the old Play B*y magazine article from back in the early 70s that proclaimed your kidneys and liver would drop out of place if you were a runner, and that you should stop running as it was bad for your health...yeah, like I trust my health to an article like that.  Folks, you have to consider the source. Your top cooking publications are good, don't take me wrong, but a big part of their appeal is to appeal to the bit of snob that is in all of us...they write stuff like this to sell their publication and the products featured there and to make  you feel good about yourself when you make an outlandish purchase.<br /><br />Anyway, we have found this Colavita oil to be quite adequate for most use.  We do use it for cooking and it gives off a very nice nutty/earthy aroma.  It is light enough to use on most of the salad dressings we make, and we do use it extensively in the various vinaigrette and herb soaks we concoct.  I will say that we do not buy this in large quantities as you can purchase it in a very nice attractive little bottle of 17 ounces...Actually we buy it two bottles at a time, always using the older bottle first and then rotating.<br /><br />This certainly in not the only oil we use, but for everyday use we find that the quality you are getting for the price simply cannot be beat.  Not that I would ever do it, but I dare say that you could prepare a nice salad dressing with this product and tell your guests that you used some of the ""really good and really expensive stuff,"" and that 9 out of ten would buy off on that statement.  Now don't do this because if your luck is like mine, the first one you told that to would the that one in ten I am talking about...embarrassing!<br /><br />This is good oil that will not take your last dollar to purchase.  I recommend it highly. I am comparing it to like oils in this price range, so I am giving it five stars.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks"
102142,B001ELLB16,A3SBGPFKLVK466,Dominic J. Spinelli,10,10,5,1246233600,"Love the oil, love the price!","I have been using Colavita for years. It is one of the finest all around X-Virgin olive oils on the market. Its extremely fruity and works very well in salads and pasta dishes. I have been struggling with olive oils since I can not find it in the stores where I now live. Now I get it shipped to my door, with free freight, and at a lower price than I used to pay in the grocery store."
102143,B001ELLB16,AI0BCEWRE04G0,Stoney,8,10,5,1262822400,Does the Job,"QUALITY<br />In my opinion, having used a dozen or so brands of olive oil, Colavita is simply the best reasonably priced olive oil which is widely available.  I've been using Colavita for several years now, and have never been dissappointed.  Colavita is excellent quality, dependable, and reasonably priced---the perfect combination for a daily general purpose olive oil.<br /><br />FLAVOR<br />Although not an ""olive oil gourmand"", I'd describe Colavita as ""rich, smooth, and neutral"". Gourmands probably have other silly terms for the flavor, such as ""fruity"" (but a ""civilian"" would never call it fruity). It is not harsh or bitter like most common olive oil, not spicy like Whole Foods 360, and not notably ""olivey"".  Colavita is an evoo (""extra virgin olive oil""---to us non-olive oil snobs), which means ""first pressing"".  Most olive-oil nuts consider the words ""extra virgin"" to be sacred.  Practically speaking though, the mere label ""extra virgin"" is not a guarantee of quality---most grocery store brands (evoo or not) are harsh and bitter, but some are good cooking oils.<br /><br />PREMIUM OILS<br />Botique premium oils are are as variable year to year as wines, comparably expensive, and have to be bought the way you buy fine wine (that is, ideally at tastings, where you confirm the quality and flavor before purchase).  Some are genuinely (as in NOT-gourmet-speak) buttery and nutty---great for dipping.  Some taste like the fragrance of flowers---great for salads.  Never cook premium olive oil---use it for dipping or drizzling, or on delicate salads.  Colavita is a good general purpose oil, better than most grocery store olive oil, but is not a premium oil.<br /><br />COOKING OIL<br />Non-extra virgin olive oils (second or later pressings) are usually darker and stronger flavored---which adds complexity to soups, sauses, stews, bean dishes etc.  If you are using a  bitter or strong-tasting olive oil, cook it WITH the dish.  I add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil to every sause, soup, stew, chili, cassrole, or bean dish, etc.  However, olive oil can ""go bad""---so unless you use alot, it doesn't sense to use a different cooking oil than you use on salads, for dipping etc.  One usually purchases good cooking oil in multi-gallon tins.  Colavita is a very good general purpose oil, and therefore a good cooking oil---albeit a bit expensive for a cooking oil.<br /><br />DIPPING OIL<br />Traditionally (and in the best restaurants), Italian bread, oil and balsamic vinegar is served as an appetizer.  The diner usually mixes his own oil and vinegar at the table.  If all three are top quality, the combination can be delicious, and can even be a light meal.  Add figs or slices of apple or pear and some olives, and you do have a meal. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAKUP0"">Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto, 5-Pound Bag</a>  Albeit probably heresy, in fact you can substitute fine wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice.  If I don't have olives, I usually add soy sause or Braggs for saltiness to the mixture. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4Y4W"">Bragg Liquid Aminos, Natural Soy Sauce Alternative, 32-Ounce Bottle , (Pack of 3)</a> Colavita is a very good ""everyday"" dipping oil.<br /><br />SALAD OIL<br />The requirements for an ""everyday"" salad oil are a little less stringent than that for a dipping oil, because the heavy flavor of the vinegar, and often pamessan, bacon bits, etc. usually dominate.  However, I rarely prepare use oil and vinegar the traditional way.  For everyday salads (or as a dip for raw vegies) I prefer olive-oil based mayo with a little freshly ground pepper, and some citrus zest.  For special salads, I use a fruity premium olive oil (and just a hint of lemon and/or orange juice and zest).  Colavita is a very good ""everyday"" salad oil.<br /><br />DRIZZING OIL<br />A drizzling oil is an oil you pour over a dish immediately before serving, or which you serve in a carafe on the table.  If you REALLY like the flavor of ""ordinary good"" olive oil (I don't)---then you will find Colavita to be a good drizzling oil.  My hispanic wife frequently drizzles Colavita on the dishes I've cooked (with Colavita), because she likes the olive-oil flavor.  By the way, the same principle applies to the use of butter, pepper, garlic, cheese, even soy sause---if you want the flavor to dominate, add it just before serving; if you want the flavor to be substle, cook the seasoning with the dish.  For most dishes I prefer a rich blend of subtle flavors.<br /><br />HEALTHY COOKING<br />I go to a great deal of effort to minimize animal fat in my diet, by very strict trimming, thorough cooking, and by chilling broth to remove the solidified fat.  However, the body needs fat and craves fat.  The ideal solution is to replace animal fat with vegetable oils which are high in omega-3s.  Olive oil is ideal for the purpose.<br /><br />My Southern grandmother could not cook any vegetables without a thick slice of fatback (fatty bacon)---and indeed her vegetables were very tasty.  Speaking of which, what is the point of healthy vegetables if no-one will eat them?  The solution is to add several tablespoon fulls of olive oil, and a teaspoon of chipped ham <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NERTSE"">Hormel Premium Real Crumbled Bacon</a> to the vegies.  For the best flavor, cook the vegies with the olive oil (do NOT add oil to the cooked vegetables---unless you really like the flavor of the oil).  Season as necessary with pepper and fresh lemon juice.  Truly delicious vegetables are possible---I eat them daily.<br /><br />ECONOMY<br />The 34 ounce tins is about half the price of the bottle per oz at this time, but is expensive compared to the last time I purchased it.  The tins are small enough to use directly. But I prefer bottles, because controlling the flow of the oil is easier (since you can see the oil approaching the spout), and it is easier to gauge the amount of oil I'm using by eye (how far the level drops in the glass bottle). So, I refill bottles from the tins.  I've been told that olive oil stays fresher in tins (measured in months and years) That becomes relevant when you don't know how many months (or even years) a bottle may have sat on a grocery shelf.<br /><br />GENERAL RECCOMENDATION<br />After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it."

Product is pretty good and arrived with only one small dent in one of the cans and no leakage, so I guess I got lucky there.<br /><br />Since ordering, it's become available in a neighborhood store in single cans at a price only slightly higher than Amazon's, which seems a little high for two cans.  Given that, I'll buy locally from now on unless Amazon lowers price.  The oil itself is pretty good and doesn't have that ""rank"" taste or smell that I associate with some EV olive oils."

For frying and other cooking uses, I keep a large container of a store brand around.  Otherwise, I use Colavita.<br /><br />From what I have tasted and researched, Colavita is a great oil.  I like to use it on my skin as well as cook with it.  It's great to drizzle on cooked food, raw food, in homemade salad dressings, dipping, or anywhere I need a ""finishing"" oil.  The quality and taste is there.  They say a sign of quality evoo is a ""bite"" or catching feeling in the back of your throat when you drink it.  After drinking Colavita straight, I will get that feeling in my throat within 2 to 5 seconds.  It shows that the good, healthy components in the evoo are still there.<br /><br />I recommend this oil as one of the best, if not the best supermarket brands of evoo."

It's a very good buy for the money, but let's be clear that it is not a ""Good"" olive oil.  True, it is extra virgin and cold pressed, but remember that any oil from large brands like Colavita, Bertolli, etc.. is filtered and mixed which means that it is not the way nature intended it.  My recommendation is that this is a great oil for cooking, and frying;fry an egg in Olive oil and you will never eat eggs another way again.  But if you want to make a simple greek salad for example, where olive and salt is the only dressing, you should go for the premium stuff that you'll find at your local gourmet food shop or in a meditteranean market.  My personal favorite (and yes I am biased because of my background) is Greek Olive oil from Messinia (southern peloponesus), but there are some varieties from Crete that are excellent as well.  Try to find one that is from a single source (meaning that it is not mixed with different varieties of olive oils to make a consistent taste), it's okay if your olive oil is different from one batch to the other, because that is natural."

102190,B0013THC2Q,A6LZNSAFNROQD,Julia,0,0,5,1294790400,Delicious.,"I just received this coffee in the mail approximately 15 minutes ago.  Since we have been out of coffee for a whole day, I promptly pulled out my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GXZ2GS"">Aerobie 80R08 AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a> and made a cup.  When I saw the nice froth after pressing the coffee, I knew it was going to be good.  I didn't expect it to be the best cup of coffee I have had since my trip to Phil'z of San Francisco which, in my opinion, is the best coffee in the world.  At this point in time, I am willing to rank this Kona Blend as number two on my all time list of great coffee.  The coffee is smooth, mellow and lacking a bitter aftertaste (the AeroPress probably helps with that).  The beans appeared fresh and were very aromatic.  I will certainly be maintaining my 'subscribe and save' status.<br /><br />After reading the previous reviews, there are two ways in which I can conceive this coffee tasting like Folger's:<br />1) The coffee was old when the reviewer received it.  I've been ordering Boyer's coffee for a while and I've never had this happen, but I am sure it is possible.<br />2) The reviewer used a drip coffee pot.  If you are picky about coffee, do your taste buds AND the beans a favor and get a better coffee maker.<br /><br />Anyway, that is my opinion.  As a student on a graduate stipend, ~$17 for a 40oz bag of great coffee is definitely worth it."

I ruined the first box trying to cook the pilaf.  I confess that, while I am an excellent cook, there are still somethings that I cannot be trusted to cook: rice and water.  A whistling teapot solved the water problem and a rice cooker solved the rice problem.  The pilaf is exactly the same as my rice problem so I experimented with cooking it in the rice cooker.  I was finally successful when I put the pilaf into the rice cooker with *exactly* the number of cups of water called for on the box--2 cups for each bag.  The lines on the side of the rice cooker are worthless for cooking this pilaf.  I also found that I had to reset the warm/cook button to cook a couple of extra times.  The resulting pilaf is a bit gummy after about an hour and I've thought about letting it sit on warm for a while to see what would happen but haven't had the time to do so yet.<br /><br />I eat cereals for breakfast:  cold and hot.  Farina must be cooked on the stove with a hand on the wisk which is not always convenient.  Heavy rolled oats may be cooked in the microwave but must be watched.  This pilaf may be cooked in the rice cooker with an occassional button pushing session.  I like that I can cook the pilaf and have it available to take to work for breakfast.  I have a cup of it for breakfast with a touch of sweetener.  It's a nice variation in textures.  My only complaint is that it is heavy on the calories.<br /><br />I have not yet used this as a side dish.  I suspect that, like rice pilafs, it will be a nice change of pace.<br /><br />Edited to add:  This review was written prior to my purchase of the nifty fancy rice cooker that I have reviewed elsewhere.  The rice cooker used here is one of the ka-ching ones."

It comes in cakes and must be ground either with a mortar & pestle or in a very sturdy grinder/blender.  It is a basic recipe which suits the majority.  Therefore, if you want it to be super spicy, you need to dress it up a bit.  Follow the package instructions for best results but use a whisk.  It needs to be made in a saucepan on top of the stove or in a Mr. Coffee Cocomotion machine.<br /><br />Grind the cakes in advance for maximum convenience and use 1 and a half times the recommended amount for best results. Use whole milk for best results or 2%.  Skim milk just doesn't work as well. For a spicier mug of cocoa, add ground chili powder to taste.  You can also add a piece of vanilla bean while cooking if you like that.  If you want even more cinnamon taste, you can cook with a cinnamon stick. You can add espresso powder as well for a nice change of pace.  Instant coffee will do in a pinch plus that's a good way to get rid of intsant coffee!<br /><br />It's best to try a few mugs of Ibarra before you decide to spice it up.  The flavor will grow on you. If you don't feel like paying the shipping fees, ask your grocer if they carry this item.  Most chain grocery stores with a Hispanic section do carry Ibarra."

Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them."

He LOVED them and they kept him busy for a while. Around the same time, he started itching and chewing on his paws incessantly and would not stop, even for a treat. Initially we thought it was the flee protection, then the shampoo, then the treats, then the peanut butter and lastly these. We continually phased each of the previous items out of his diet/lifestyle until finally we determined that the itching and scratching was related to these. We've obviously stopped giving these to him and now he rarely scratches or chews on himself. Your dog may have a different reaction to them but if he's experienceing any of the above symptoms, it may be related to these."

Milk and Egg based proteins take longer, so you get a constant flow of protein rather than having your body trying to absorb it a couple times a day.

The past few months, I also needed to take a presciption medication that made me nauseous regularly.<br /><br />This remains as THE ONLY FOOD that I can hold down when I am ill and recovering from a stomach bug.  It is gentle, mild flavored, completely smooth, can be mixed to any consistency (from 'smoothie'-like to paste-like)...and it just stays down.  Doctors always say to start back on food with that ""BRAT"" diet -- banana, rice, applesauce, toast -- well, this seems to have 3/4 of those in 1 box!<br /><br />As a bonus, it has excellent nutritional value -- gives you some vitamins and such, versus when you only eat plain rice or toast.  It gets me back on my feet much sooner...and it takes almost no effort to make it (important to me, since when I'm sick, I don't want to be 'vertical' any longer than I have to!)  I usually just mix it with water, which works wonderfully (I stay away from dairy if I'm ill).  You can eat it cold or warm.  I find it to be kind of soothing when I'm under the weather.<br /><br />It doesn't spoil, and I always keep some on hand just because you never know when you'll get sick (or at least I don't, what with students sneezing in my face!!)  ;-)<br /><br />Finally, I must admit that I think it's YUMMY!  I do wish they still made just the banana rice kind -- I wonder why they discontinued that, which I remember having as far back as the 1970s?  But this is pretty close.<br /><br />I'll admit to having a little bowl of it now or then just as comfort food!  :-)"

This tea isn't even on the scale, as it appears the quality is below what people in China would buy for the cheapest price at a local supermarket. To begin with, the tea is chopped or broken up into something resembling large flakes of fish food. (Note: it does not resemble the picture of the tea leaves shown on the product page at all.) Second, because of this condition, the tea has an overall powdery and dry character to it. Now, maybe you will say, ""But what about the taste? Maybe it tastes just the same..."" No, it doesn't. It is basically tasteless and bland, the opposite of high quality green tea in this style. The best quality green tea leaves in this style are small and bright green. When steeped, they give a fresh and vegetal flavor with all sorts of subtlety and deliciousness. This tea has none of those qualities. In summary: this tea is not good, and especially for the price. Please do yourself a favor and avoid it. In China, I doubt even poor people would drink this tea, which makes me sad to say since I bought it. :-(<br /><br />Foojoy's Longjing in teabags is infinitely superior to this tea, and is a real Longjing.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007V1Q7I"">Foojoy Lungching (Dragonwell) Green Tea - 100 Individually Wrapped Tea Bags</a>"

When I read it, I was hoping his critical comments would prove to be simply wrong, or at least too harsh.  But in fact they are right on target.  First, he is correct that the tea itself does not look at all like the image on the webpage (it doesn't consist of what looks like rolled leaves, but rather is in tiny flakes).  Most importantly, he is right about the flavor.  There is practically none; and the flavor that is there is stale, dull.  It is the most insipid green tea I have ever drunk (and I have drunk many kinds, from China, Japan, Sri Lanka, etc.); but in light of the off-putting nature of the flavor, I was actually glad there was not more of it.  This tea might, in light of its price, look like a bargain; instead, it is exactly the opposite...a complete waste of money."

I find that I drink a lot more water during the day with these than with filtered water.  The taste is absolutely wonderful and refreshing ---- just a tiny hint of flavoring.  No syrupy flavor like all the trendy ""fitness drinks"" out there and no carbonation or harmful artificial sweetners like with diet soda.<br /><br />I was an absolute Diet Coke junkie for fifteen years until I found this product.  No hyperbole ---- it's literally the only thing that I can keep in the fridge that will keep me away from Diet Coke.  It might seem a bit pricey, but for my health I think it is worth every penny.  I just wish they would stock a larger size so I wouldn't feel so bad about all of the discarded plastic bottles.  Also, this may seem a small point but I am a sculptor and thoughtful graphic design is very important to me.  I always get compliments when I hand these out to guests ---- both on the flavor and the wonderful packaging.<br /><br />My favorite flavors are the pear and the watermelon.  They are very subtle.  My husband's favorite is the honeydew-hibiscus.  I like it, too, but it has a tiny sour floral tang to the taste.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot recommend this product highly enough."

Low salt, fat free,cholesterol free, organic, a good source of,protein(8 g per serving),potassium, calcium and iron.All those things are what I'm looking for and the only reason I give 2 stars. But the one area they are lacking is good taste. I am not new to low sodium foods. I have been using and on the look out for it for years. Always trying to find something that tastes good as well as is healthy. The products seem to be getting better and better and I have recommended several items. My favorite at this time is Amy's brand. I would especially recommend<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G18NR0"">Amy's Light in Sodium Organic Minestrone Soup, 14.1-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> (see my review for details)to anyone trying to switch over to low sodium as an example of how good it can be. But Amy's didn't have any low sodium baked beans, so I decided to give this Eden brand a try.<br /><br />I guess if i could only use one word to describe the taste - it would be ""blechhh"". It leaves a horrible sour sort of after taste in my mouth that makes me shudder, and they are really dry going down. I wouldn't recommend buying these in bulk. If you see these at your local market and want to try a can for yourself, that would be advisable, but have some applesauce or some other favorite side to wash these down.<br /><br />One other good thing I could say is that they have a long shelf life. Which is where they will stay - on my shelf - unless I have some big emergency, and even then I'd have to be desperate.<br /><br />Ingredients for those interested are:<br />Organic Navy beans,Water,Organic Sorghum,Tomato Puree,Organic Apple Cider Vinegar,Organic Mustard seed,Organic Onion and spices, sea salt.<br /><br />Sorry but this is one healthy product I can't recommend.....Laurie"

I'm more used to baked beans being made with brown sugar or maple syrup, so the sorghum is a little strong for me.  However if I add just a tbsp of grade b maple syrup or agave nectar it sweetens it right up for me.

102469,B001SAQTIS,A268LOQQCRTGUH,Chris Baker,0,0,4,1254182400,This is a wonderful wing sauce,"I saw a bottle of this at my local grocer. I love jalapenos and seeing a red jalapeno sauce made it a must buy.<br /><br />The sauce was not what I expected, I was expecting a thin vinegary kind of Mexican hot sauce. This sauce is much thicker than that, but not as thick as ketchup. It is a bit tangy with a balance of sweet and heat. The label says ""Very Hot"", but it will only seem this way to those who are more sensitive to heat than the average spicy food fan.<br /><br />After my first taste the first thing that came to mind was hot wings. They have the perfect tangy/sweet/hot sort of flavor profile, along with a consistency that lends itself very well to sticking to wings (both cooked and raw). It is also thick enough to be brushed on wings while they are being cooked on a grill. I began to wonder if the brand name was called ""Bufalo"" because it was intended to be used for wings, but after some research I found out that the company name precedes Buffalo Wings by quite a long time, the name is pure coincidence.<br /><br />As a wing sauce this stuff is a welcome addition. It is a very slight change from your standard hot wing flavor, being made with Jalapenos, while still very true to the flavor you expect from hot wings. As a hot sauce on its own it is good but each time I try it on something else I keep coming back to how much this tastes like a wing sauce.<br /><br />I recommend giving this stuff a try to see what you think. Definitely try it on your next set of wings. My next bottle will be the larger sized bottle because I plan to make some more wings with this stuff."

Add a few drops of hickory liquid smoke to pick it up a notch.  Jalapeno bacon salt?  Buy some fresh jalapenos and dry them in the oven then toss them in with the bacon when you pulverize.  This isn't rocket science and I agree with other posts... if ya want to know what this tastes like just buy a bottle of bacos and smash them into a salt like substance to sprinkle around.

My 6 yr old rescue lab mix was eating it but would throw up often. I read reviews for Acana and Origen. I first switched to the high protein Origen with chicken and it made my dogs very gassy. I switched to Acana Prairie which is also with chicken and they LOVE THIS FOOD. Even my fussy Papillon loves it. The other 2 wipe their bowls clean. It is hard to find and a little pricy so I just signed up for automatic deliveries. This is a great dog food!

It was not until I had a cat diagnosed with heart disease that I found out more information about feline nutrition.  Basically, protein is very important (it's what they would be eating if they were in the wild) and grains can be hard for them to digest.  Since that time, I've tried to do better in making sure they get the proper nutrition to keep them as healthy as possible.<br /><br />Science Diet has a new line of cat food available called Ideal Balance.  It features fresh chicken as the first ingredient, fruits and veggies as secondary ingredients and is free of corn, artificial flavors and preservatives.  It is conveniently available in the Kitten, Adult and Mature Adult varieties.<br /><br />When I gave my cats this dry food, they enthusiastically ate it. This is actually nothing new. They do that with all cat food. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find that as the days went by and they continued eating the food, there was less throwing up from one of our cats who apparently has a sensitive stomach.  I have no doubt the switching of brands is what caused her throwing up to lessen.  Although Science Diet does cost more than other brands you can find in the big box stores, the higher price is worth it to be able to give my cats good nutrition.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a bag of Science Diet Ideal Balance Cat Food free via BzzAgent.

As I mentioned in the title, there are no calories, fats, carbs or sugars. The taste is very sweet and vanillery, and you can use it in anything you want to add a little variety or flavor. I like it in my Pellegrino. Makes a nice Vanilla Soda. In my coffee, I found I did not have to add anything else. The syrup was good enough and tasty enough on it's own.I use it whenever, I get a sweet tooth, to get me past a craving for something with more calories involved.<br /><br />It is sweetened with ""Splenda"", and if you are not used to using Sugar substitutes, you may not like the little bit of an after taste it leaves.<br /><br />Ingrediants as listed are: Water, Vanilla Extract,other natural flavors, Potassium Sorbate and Sodium Benzoate(there are 5 mg sodium listed on the label), Citric Acid,Xanthan Gum,Sucralose(the Splenda), Acesulfame Potassium.<br /><br />It's a bargain for the 750 ml, sold here.I paid almost as much for 375ml at my local grocery store. You'll probably use about two tablespoons per drink.(more or less) You'll get your money's worth. Add it to anything you want, hot chocolate, iced tea, etc. Maybe with the holiday's coming, it would be a nice change in other beverages as well. It is also sold with sugar added,and there are several other flavors with or without sugar, just click on other products by Torani at top of page. .<br /><br />Cheers....Laurie"

If you want better pasta, you'll pay through the nose or you'll make it yourself. It is a step up from Barilla (which does not make Orecchiette), and cooks up a little differently.  It tends to be a bit creamier without loosing its firmness.  Orecchiette is a wonderful summer pasta that is perfect with broccoli and sausage.<br /><br />Value: For some reason, the De Cecco pastas are all different prices.  This one is the least expensive and is one of my favorites.  Amazon's price (as of April 2011) is considerably cheaper than the grocery store's non-sale price, and slightly less expensive than the on-sale price.<br /><br />Packaging: There is a lot of plastic and a cardboard backing preventing the pasta from shattering during shipping.  I'm glad to have in tact pasta so I don't mind too much.  The five-pack is shipped in a box that is too large for it adding another layer of waste.  I suspect that the packaging could be reduced without any increase in breakage."

Perfect bite, perfect taste... if I had a gripe, I'd say that you have to cook it for one minute less than the recommended al dente time in order to get it properly al dente, but once you know that, you're golden.

Studies have shown 7-8% is ideal for gastric emptying and absorption rates. Many drinks are much sweeter, which makes the gut draw water from muscles to dilute the mixture. Thankfully that is not the case here.<br />* It mixes very well, and tastes great.<br />* Good price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Only one: it has 200% RDA of vitamin C per serving. Since about 2g of vitamin C in a day is the safe upper limit, that puts a limit on how much you can drink in very long activities.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />* Contains glutamine and BCAAs (2mg per serving). If you have an energy deficit, which you almost certainly will when you drink this, they will probably just be burned as energy.<br /><br />Other drinks all seem to be either a) expensive, b) more sweet than they should be, c) mix poorly and/or taste terrible, or d) full of protein that is not appropriate during or immediately after a workout.

But about a year ago my sister had a health scare with her animals and they kept throwing up while eating Purina. We did a lot of research together and learned about the types of food you really SHOULD be giving your cats. Apparently most cat food has main ingredients that would not normally be found in a cat's diet (always check the first three, those tell what the majority of food is made of.) Things like corn and grain are not good for kitties, and they...well to be frank...they eat more, they poop more, and when they DO poop, it's waaaaayyy stinky.<br /><br />A lot of people recommended a variety of brands, and this was one that was actually on the cheaper end, but still had better ingredients. My kitties LOVE it (they love the Wellness in the brown and cream bag more, but this is cheaper.) They eat less cat food and seem to be more satisfied. I calculated how long it takes them to go through a large bag like this versus the cost of it. It costs me about (or a little over) 50 cents a day to feed two kitties. All the protein in it keeps them more full so they eat less of it! I'd say that's not a bad deal. The pieces are pretty small so it's easy for them to chew on.

If you want to change to this -- just be aware that anytime you change your cat's food, you have to do so very gradually over about a week's time, mixing the new with the old in gradually increasing amounts. Never just switch from one food to another, or you are asking for stomach upsets. The people who make this food actually recommend feeding a mix of dry kibbles with the canned food, which is how I feed it. I have three Manx cats that I have switched over to this food and they are doing extremely well. Their coats have improved and they have more energy. One of my boys has lost weight on their low-calorie formula and he looks great. My female has stopped scratching herself and her fur has grown back where she licked it off -- I think she had food allergy issues with her old food. My other boy has issues with struvites and was on a prescription diet from the vet. However, the manufacturer even said he couldn't stay on it forever without constant blood testing because it could harm his kidneys! Who wants to feed their cat something that could harm his kidneys?? So far, after several months on Wellness, he's doing great. Their food keeps the Ph of the urine low, which is great for a cat with his problems. So many of the store bought foods are literally full of garbage -- rejected stuff that would be thrown away. Meat by-products contain some pretty horrible stuff. Also, cats are carnivores and need meat -- not cereal, which is a main ingredient in many cat foods. When's the last time you saw a cat in the wild eating corn or meal? Wellness has human grade meat as its main ingredient and also contains healthy veggies.  My two boys are on the Lite formula and my girl is on Adult Super5 Mix. I'm glad a friend told me about it. Highly recommended."

They both had a clean bill of health without any allergies or problems (other than the occasional hairball) but I started them on this brand after some reasearch because I wasn't happy about the nasties in the old food and how it left dye all around the water bowl (Boo = messy eater, he likes to pick out his food and it ends up all over the place).<br /><br />After a couple months of changing Boo's food, there was less bits of food being flung around and floating in his bowl, there wasn't a brown ring around his drinking fountain and there was even less fur in his foutain (granted, the latter may have more to do with the seasons and shedding).<br /><br />When I took Boo back to the vet about 6 months after changing the food, the Dr. mentioned that he was a bit iffy because it was werid to have fruit in cat food. He also said that he's noticed several cats that have kidney problems after years of eating Wellness (and checked to see if I was feeding them wet food as well - they eat Nutro Max pouches too. However, throughout the whole exam, he commented several times on how Boo's fur was very shiney, full and didn't have any flakes or dandruff like some of the other black cats he's seen.  At the end the Dr., somewhat jokeingly, said ""Ok, if his coat is THIS nice, I have to look into this some more and change my mind about the brand!""<br /><br />Poxie was a scruffy looking girl and spent a couple months at the pound before we adopted her. She had just given birth to kittens before being placed for adoption and was spayed ASAP. She had her own room and didn't have to fight for food while at the pound, but she was on the thin side and her fur was dry and had a brittle feeling. She's been eating Wellness for about three weeks now and her coat has already settled down and is more sleek and silkier.<br /><br />So overall, notciable changes in both their coats (as a general indication of their health) and a huge improvement quality/ingredient wise compared to what they were fed at the pound. I have been recommending Wellness to everybody who askes me about my kitties!"

His vet suggested that allergies might be the culprit, so before spending hundreds of dollars on allergy testing, she suggested that I switch him to a premium diet (grain-free, if possible).  Switching from a diet of Fancy Feast (aka Kitty Crack) and Friskies was no easy task! He refused to eat Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and a few other brands of dry food.  For some unknown reason, he's taken a liking to his Wellness Complete Health! It does have a meaty, natural smell and feels slightly oily to the touch.<br /><br />His coat is much shinier, he's dandruff free, and his earwax problem has improved by about 30%.  On the downside, he's gained weight.  My vet said that this food is higher in calories than most other brands, so you'll want to be sure your cat isn't overeating.  Also, I've found that if Moses's diet isn't supplemented with wet food, he gets constipated (which was diagnosed by the tiny balls of poop that stick to his butt or end up around the house).

I have been experimenting with various canned and dry cat foods for my 2 cats (one is a 9 month old kitten and the other is a 3 year old).  They're generally not picky eaters, but when I decided a few months ago to switch them from Purina Indoor Cat food and Purina One Kitten Chow to higher quality cat foods, I did a considerable amount of research.<br /><br />I started them off with Evo Turkey & Chicken food, which they seemed to love at first.  At some point after I opened the second bag of Evo, they started to turn their noses up at meal time.  Not only that, I also noticed what some other Evo reviewers have said: that their breath and poo were very stinky.  My kitten loves to cuddle and my acute sense of smell just made that experience unbearable, to say nothing of litter duty.<br /><br />So onward to other options.  I figured I'd try the other highly touted Wellness brand.  Perhaps I should have predicted that they would hate this brand cat food since I had previously bought Wellness cat treats, which they will.not.eat.  I mean, they don't refuse much, but they refuse those treats.  But, since I wanted to stick with a high quality brand, I decided to try Wellness.  My cats eat it, but only do so begrudgingly and it's clear they do not enjoy it.  I have had to resort to mixing in canned food to make it more palatable until the bag is finished.  Oh, and their breath is still nauseating -- a different kind than with Evo, but still very noticeable.<br /><br />I suppose it's just as well; I was planning to switch them to canned food eventually, which they love.  The problem now is that I will have to start another hunt for the right canned food because I can't tell if the options I'm offering now are just being devoured because they actually like the flavor or if it's just better than the Wellness.<br /><br />Bottom line: as with any new pet foods, buy a small quantity before committing to it.  Especially when you're paying a premium."

Note that as other reviewers have stated, they are very small (what do you want for 110 calories?) and, as such, intended for young children-- this would do nothing for my appetite, but they are perfect for the under-5 set as a snack. I always sample everything I give my son, and I thought these were pretty good. If your kids do not have a pre-existing sweet tooth, they will probably like these. I thought they would have the consistency of a Nutri-Grain bar, but they are a little more ""dry"" than that-- as a result, they create more ""crumbs"" than I had anticipated, but I'm more than willing to live with it, based on the fact that they are organic (do not want to feed my son Nutri-Grain bars-- too sweet, and not organic!). The PB is very thin and so there is little danger of choking.<br /><br />Aside from the crumbs, the only real drawback for me is that they are not fortified-- no iron, zinc, little to no vitamins, etc. I do not think it would cost the company much money to add these ingredients; I thought it was sort of standard practice to fortify children's cereal/grain products, so I'm not sure why the company decided not to."

102659,B002C0Z4OS,AOQ2IB802NXAQ,Irishlawlass,0,1,5,1318204800,They're for TODDLERS people -- not YOU!,"First -- let me be clear I don't work for this company or have any kind of connection to  them. I'm just a mom whose kid likes them. These snacks are intended for toddlers or preschoolers -- not for the more mature (sugar numbed?) palate of an older/grade school aged child or an adult. Ever try baby food? It's pretty bland. These are not bland but they're probably not going to be the cookie treat to have with tea for an adult. They do actually taste like peanut butter and jelly -- just maybe not the Goober brand of candy sweet pb&j that comes combined in the same jar, or the creamy sugar-packed Jiff PB and Smucker's grape jelly you may glob onto white sandwich bread. This is a healthy snack and my two year-old LOVES them. She would eat the whole box (as I think most TODDLERS/PRESCHOOLERS would) if given the chance. As for the one reviewer's bug report, this may come as a shock but these are made with fruit and fruit sometimes has bugs on/around/in it. Not saying I wouldn't be thoroughly grossed out myself but stuff happens and maybe one got by them. I've never had that experience in the year we've been giving these to our daughter. Sometimes you find a piece of bone in your hamburger or you get a seed in your seedless watermelon -- it just happens. It doesn't mean you never eat those foods again. These snacks are organic, they're made with healthful ingredients and they save the day when your child won't eat enough (or any) of the dinner you made or when they're sick and super picky about what they want to eat or when they're hungry and the next meal is still an hour or more away. Don't pass these up. Grab a single box of them at BRU and see if YOUR TODDLER likes them. After all, that's what matters."

The ""gel"" tasted on its own is watery and barely gives off the slightest taste of something sweet; I definitely could never identify it as strawberry.  Somehow, the pineapple also manages to be completely bland.  Other than ths stringy texture, there is no flavor present that even suggests pineapple -- it could as easily be pieces of pear or peach.

But now I cant get it here in the South.  By itself this sauce is very thin (almost too thin). It has a tangy, spicy flavor on the vinegary side. I like as a dipping sauce but I think most will not find it all that appealing by itself. But this is the secret ingredient to making you own custom BBQ sauce simply by adding it to a more sweet, thick type such as KC Masterpiece or the like. They go perfect together.  Just mix it about 50:50 to the other sauce, put it in an open sauce pan on the stove or side burner of your grill, and let it simmer to slowly reduce it to a sticky mouth watering unique blend (add a bit of cayenne pepper powder if you like.  When the meat is about 5 minutes from being done then coat it with the cooked down sauce using a silicon brush and grill for another 5 mins. Try it, your guests will be raving about your BBQ! BTW - this is a good price including the shipping (other online grocers -ie Hometown Favorites -- charge 2 times this sellers shipping and for only 6 bottles not 12.  That's a scam if you ask me."

I had bought one of their 'Pit Bull Tested' toys - some knobby thing -  for my half pit bull mutt.  He enjoyed the knobby thing but it was in tiny bits in under 5 minutes.  I pulled the package out of the trash and emailed nylabone with a complaint.  Much to my surprise they responded the next day and sent me the Galileo Souper bone at no charge. My dog loved it.  Nylabone later paid my dog $25 to test a new and improved 'knobby' product but it didn't last either.  However the Galileos are great and we keep buying them.  We get about 9-12 mos out of each one before they get down to plum size.  They keep his teeth nice and clean too.  The floor does tend to vibrate when he grasps it with his paws and start gnawing (wood floor over a crawl space) which is a little odd but does impress visitors :-)

Start the puppy out on the puppy nylabones.  Follow instructions and help the pup's interest level by smearing some peanut butter on it, and so on.<br /><br />The first time we saw a Galileo Bone,  we were mystified,  but the sales clerk said he had one and it lasted years!  And guess what?  It did!  Our dog is over 8 years old now,  and has two Galileo's.  He doesn't chew on them constantly,  but whenever he feels like it.  It helps keep his molars free of tartar and satisfies his craving to chew.<br /><br />One of the bone's 3 tips was getting chewed waaaay close to the stump and finally broke off.  According to instructions,  that's the time to retire it and get a new one.<br /><br />I've paid over $20 each for these and feel they were worth it at that price.  Now they are almost half that.  Good deal.<br /><br />Natural (real) bones are dangerous and rawhide chews can get stuck in the throat,  swell in the stomach and even cause bowel impaction.  Don't use them.  If you insist,  supervise the dog so you can assist if the above problems happen.  It has happened to us.<br /><br />But use Nylabones and don't worry about it!  It may take some training at first,  maybe not.  If it does,  it's worth it."

Then we found the Galileo Nylabone and the black Kong toys. These were a blessing, as no matter how hard he would try, he couldn't tear them up. The Galileo Nylabone is designed so that it just comes off in little shreds - nothing big to swallow. Our Rotty has been chewing them for nearly 10 years, and still likes them.

I dream of the day when I find him a soft chew toy that outlasts his jaws of steel, but for now, the only toy I found that lasts for a substantial amount of time is the Galileo Nylabone (Souper size).  He has two that he has been chewing on for about 2 years now and while he has certainly been able to chew away a bit of them, for the most part they are still intact.  He actively searches out his Nylabone at least twice a day and chews on it for no less than 20 minutes at a time.  The nice thing about this toy is that you NEVER find large chunks of it coming off while they play---just as the company describes, nothing larger than a small grain of rice ever comes off during a chew period.  Once in a while, to sterilize the toy and to add a little 'wow' factor back into it, I boil it in a big pot of water containing a couple chix boullion cubes---he LOVES this!!!"

Nothing else lasts as long and occupies them as Nylabone does.  They always fight over this one in particular - perhaps they like it because it is much larger than all their other Nylabones.  This is definitely the largest one I have seen, so I would only recommend this for someone with a large dog.

A Galileo Bone came with him and it has by far been his favorite toy. He has had it since Spring 2006 and by Fall 2011 he had managed to chew on the t-bone side down to what looked like a hatchet blade. In Novemeber, we adopted a 6 year old Pit Bull, Kratos, and he to has fallen in love with this bone, so much I just ordered 2 more in hopes that they will last as long as the first one has.

They grab it with their two front paws and will knaw on it for a half hour straight. It seems like it will last for a long time and the more they chew it, the more they enjoy it. It doesn't make a mess when they're chewing, the ends fray into something like tooth brush scrubbers, but don't break off.  I don't think the 5mo old would enjoy it as much if the 10mo old hadn't already started chewing it to create these scrubbers. It's probably best for dogs that have their adult teeth grown in. It would be too tough for the little one to knaw into a brand new one. I'm ordering a second one so they don't have to share it anymore! :)"

I put peanut butter on it hoping that would at least get them to realize it was something for their mouths and handed it to our 6 month old Pitbull.  She licked the peanut butter off then went back to the old bone.  When my son took her to bed, he took the bone too.  The next morning I found the bone back in the living room and it had been gnawed on enthusiastically.  She loves it!  She's put hours in on it and it's nowhere near being chewed up yet - just chewed on.  Now when the yellow lab takes the kong and the chocolate lab takes the rubber bone, she has her own (very phallic looking) toy."

The only toys to stand up to her jaw so far have been this bone, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AR0I8"">KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Large, Red</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050QBSKU"">Hartz Ruff Rewards Dog Toy for Strong Chewers, Bacon Flavor - Large (50+ lbs.)</a>.<br /><br />We've had this bone for almost 4 months now, and it still has maybe another 6-8 months in it. She has only managed to get little specks off at a time, so it seems quite harmless. She'd go through other Nylabones much quicker.<br /><br />My only complaints are that as you get tougher with the Nylabones, they get harder (as opposed to a rubbery material like the Kong toys). So be prepared for a very solid, plasticky bone. I just weighed her bone (she was a little confused) and it was still about 10 oz. It doesn't seem like a lot, but it can definitely hurt when dropping-at-your-feet accidentally becomes dropping-ON-your-foot. It also makes quite a noise on hard wood floor. Finally, it gets very prickly as it gets chewed on, which makes it a little more painful when it meets your foot. But I guess this is a trade off for a durable bone when it isn't a rubbery material.<br /><br />So, overall we are happy with the bone. Our dog loves it (a little too much when we find it in our bed) and it has lasted a while. We'll probably buy another one when it's gone. It is just unfortunate that it is so heavy/loud at times.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful. Leave a comment if there are any questions I can answer about this bone. Thanks!"

This is the only bone that I've found that she has not been able to destroy or shred into pieces that might be a danger to her.  I bought a second just to have on hand for when she finally wears her way through this one!
102860,B0061PPLYI,A1T8KV4XK2LJ,Kristen,0,0,5,1190332800,My dog's favorite bone,"I bought my golden retriever his first Galileo bone about 4 years ago.  He *loves* this bone, and it is the only bone he has repeatedly gone back to over the years (and believe me, this spoiled dog has been able to sample just about every bone ever made).  It's impossible to break off large chunks, so it takes a very long time for it to wear down.  I finally just bought him his 2nd bone a few weeks ago, and the original one is probably still a third of its original size.  He chews on it 5-6 nights every week, while the rest of his bones collect dust.  I can't recommend it enough, especially for those ""power chewers"".  I don't know what they do to the bones to retain the flavor, but it works!  Don't let the expensive price tag fool you--they last for years.<br /><br />Update 10/5/10: Believe it or not, my dog still loves this bone!  I've gone through another two in the last few years, but how could I not have one for him?  He chews on it virtually every day.  I'm glad to see the price has gone down a bit since I first started buying them."

She is an extremely aggressive chewer and most toys don't last 5 minutes. I thought this would be the perfect solution.<br /><br />I gave it to her a few hours a day supervised, and she loved it. About a week later I noticed blood all over the floor. Her whole mouth was cut up from the ""rice size"" pieces that clean the teeth. Despite her mouth being massacred, she still chewed on the toy. I had to throw it away so she wouldnt hurt herself. I touched it as well and it was SHARP.<br /><br />What a waste of money. I still cant find any toys for my dog to chew without her  ripping them up or hurting herself..... sigh.."

So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating."

It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.

I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor.

I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it.

I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around."

Although I will use Splenda, I am not fond of the aftertaste.  I've tried Truvia too, which also has an aftertaste.  I guess since none of these sugar substitutes are really sugar, they're all going to have an aftertaste.  So while this product is no different, the slight vanilla flavor helps to either cut down on the aftertaste or distracts your tastebuds from it.  One downside is that the bottle goes quickly for hardcore coffee drinkers, which probably more expensive than just straight Splenda.  Overall, I think it's a good alternative to sugar and would recommend it to those who are trying to cut down on sugar consumption."

I absolutely LOVED the Canfield's/Graf's Diet Swiss Creme soda, and have been craving it since they stopped making it several years ago.  Because this syrup had gotten such good reviews and the 3-pack price was good on Amazon, I ordered the pack and couldn't wait for it to arrive.  I bought a couple 2-liter bottles of carbonated water in anticipation of the delivery, and had made my first glass of diet cream soda within 5 minutes of receiving the package.  While it wasn't bad, I wasn't very impressed.  For lack of a better way to explain it, the flavor wasn't as 'full-bodied' as I had hoped.  I found that I had to use quite a bit of the syrup to get enough flavor, but even then it wasn't what I had been hoping for.  I would be 100% okay with having to use a lot of it if it tasted like my favorite pop.  I had high hopes for it to taste similar to the Canfield's, but it really didn't at all.  It basically tastes exactly like what it is -- diet vanilla syrup.  I'm hoping to come up with other uses for it, so the remaining 2.5 bottles I have don't go to waste."

Now that I see it on Amazon I will purchase here -- it is cheaper than at Target.<br /><br />I have been using this specific litter for about 16 months now and cannot rave enough about how great it is for odor absorbency. I grabbed this brand, really, just to try it... after a lifetime of being a cat owner I am compelled to try every cat litter I see on my quest for a fresh smelling home.  WOOHOO!  I hit the jackpot with this stuff!  My (wait, mine?) litter box is located in the basement laundry room of my Seattle home... plenty musty and damp.  So if any cat litter can handle cat urine AND that environment, it's got to be amazing.  Seriously, this stuff doesn't let any of that ammonia stench out into the air.  Ok, it does... but that's when the litter is overdue to be completely changed.  For reference, we empty the fecal solids as needed, and when we do, we mix together the non-urine saturated litter with the clean, blue litter.  And every 2 weeks we completely change the whole litter box.  I use a little more than half the bag at that time (MEANING... 2 BAGS SHOULD LAST A SINGLE CAT OWNER 4-6 WEEKS, depending on your specific cat and litter box location) Anyway, really - give this stuff a try and you will be hooked just  like I am.<br /><br />As for the other reviewer and the blue dust?  I really have no idea about that.  I don't have blue dust on my tables and washing machines (I just wiped mine down a few minutes after reading her review so I could see if I'd been breathing in blue dust).  I appear not to have that issue."

For the first few weeks, I loved it and continued purchasing.  We keep the litter box in an small unused bathroom in our basement.  This fall, my inlaws came to visit and would be staying in the basement on an extra bed.  In preperation, I cleaned the bathroom and was horrified to discover a thick layer of blue dust all over the bathroom.  It clearly showed on the white paper towels!.  It was everywhere.  On the walls, ceiling, floor, behind the door, etc, and it was thick.  For a synthetic product, the amount of dust was unbelievable.  I cannot recommend this product.  I have returned to traditional litter, and am disgusted thinking about the amount of blue dust that has probably been circulating our house.  We've never had a dust problem with litter before and clean the bath room ever few weeks.  I could not believe the amount of dust on the ceiling! Simply unacceptable.  There is no excuse for a sythetic product that is supposed to be absorbant to spew blue particles into the air, our lungs, and the environment I live in.  Avoid."

I have two large cats (Bengals) and I tried this litter to see if it could hold up for a week when I went away on vacation.  First, it limits the mess cats leave when they exit the box. Second, I did not smell the box when I entered the house and it doesn't bother my cats in any way.  To get the best use, you should remove deposits from the litter box daily.  Don't let it pile up. Stir the liter to reactivate it so that the wet litter can move the bottom and the fragrance can reactivate.  You will also enjoy it's benefit."

We thaw one a week and slow-braise them with fabulous gravies (usually including sliced apples) but heart is also good cooked on the grill and kept pink inside.  There are many good recipe ideas on the internet.  My only tips would be to not get too crazy trying to cut away all the meat from the silver-skin and tubules - in other words, there will be a lot of meat still attached to the bits you throw out (but the dogs will eat it all up!) and also to have your knives really sharp.  Even with throwing out quite a bit, you will still be left with enough good meat to serve at least 6 adults.  If you've never tried heart - give it a go!  It is considered muscle meat rather than organ meat like kidneys or liver and is very flavorful with a pleasant chewy texture.  Check out You-Tube for cleaning and slicing instructions."

You will also find an occasional reference to ""Caramel"" on this page, but note that the reviews you see here are for a DIFFERENT product.<br /><br />Finally, do yourself a favor and get the plain Caramel and not the Classic Caramel.  It is 10X better.  I can go through a bottle of the regular Caramel in less than a week.  The regular Caramel is sooooo good.  In comparison, no one will drink the Classic Caramel.  Shame on Amazon.

While there may be better flavorings out there, I think what makes this particular brand great is that it's difficult to tell the difference between the regular and the sugar free, and I've tried both. Finding good sugar free flavorings is difficult.  I've found this available at my local Smart-n-Final if you want to try it out before investing in a three pack.

I will admit they are probably going to be an acquired taste for some.  I've only bought the natural from amazon.  I tried some of the other flavors and found them a poor product.  Their additional flavors were in harsh contrast to the natural flavor of the ostrich meat so I can see how some would see it as a turn off.  My personal opinion though.<br /><br />Like a few other said, I don't like the inconsistency.  Sometimes the quality is good, sometimes not. I'm wondering if there are dips in the ostrich meat market where they have to sometimes use meat they normally wouldn't.  Or if they were left in bad conditions too long during transport.

A scoop of protein powder is about 28g of protein.<br />Also, despite what the product description states, it has 1.5g grams of total fat per stick.<br /><br />In short, a decent, but expensive, product if you are looking for a slim-jim style snack.<br /><br />I think I'll stick to protein powder for cheap protein, cold cuts/tuna when I want a protein-based snack, and some nice specialty Jerky when I want splurge on something chewy and flavorful."

Unfortunately, this was not the case with my purchase in February of 2011. In an attempt to shave costs off of my high protein diet that can over 1,000 dollars per month for one person, I decided to purchase 60 Ostrim sticks (3 x 20) in regular, barbecue and teriyaki flavors. Since the expiration dates of these are generally a year into the future, I assumed that I could store the sticks for several weeks.  I was dead wrong.<br /><br />After about four weeks of storing the sticks at room temperature, several of the shrink-wrapped air-tight sticks started inflating like balloons. This is a sign CO2 and methane being generated during decomposition. The inflated sticks were discarded and the few remaining that were still in their normal shrink-wrapped state were placed in a refrigerator.<br /><br />About a week later, I ate three refrigerated sticks just before heading to a venue for which I purchased tickets.  This enabled me to get an exact timeline of the events, which are chronicled below.  Suffice it to say, about four hours after eating three of the refrigerated sticks, I became deathly ill.  I am 99% certain the Ostrim sticks were the source of the food poisoning due to the highly controlled, high protein diet at the time where every food, calorie, and gram of protein was being monitored.<br /><br />The symptoms were so severe, I thought about going to the hospital. My girlfriend at the time was a physician who was able to provide some assurance that the issue was not life threatening. It took about three days to recover, which meant three days of zero productivity. In the end, a regular Ostrim consumer became someone who cringes at the very sight of the Ostrim display at my health club.<br /><br />Timeline of Ostrim Food Poisoning<br /><br />Event..........Date..........Time<br />Order from Amazon..........2/11/2011<br />Package Arrived ..........2/16/2011<br />Discard of inflated (decomposed) ..........

I hoped that the fish would be good for her skin and the rice would be easy to digest.  We have been using this food now for a couple of months and she LOVES it, plus her scratching is gone and this food has never upset her stomach.

My labradoodle developed a skin irritation that turned into a nasty infection in late november.  She was on Wellness Super 5 and salmon oil.  We thought it was just bacterial and dosed with antibiotics, but the irritation/infection came back worse than before.  I had tried grain free(Wellness Core), but things got worse, if anything.  We had to do another round of antibiotics due to another infection fromt he irritation and I felt like I was out of obvious solutions.  My vet suggested changing the type of protein to seafood(she has always been on chicken), so I tried this type of food.  Within a week of being fully transitioned onto this food, her excessive shedding (that started in november with the infections) had gone away and her skin had stopped developing lesions.  It's been almost a month and thing look great.  It could all be a coincidence, but I don't think I will be changing her food anytime soon!  Seems like a great solution for her.  Definitely worth trying!<br /><br />UPDATE July 28 2012<br />This formula (Salmon/Rice) has been changed to Salmon/Potato.  The number of ingredients have nearly doubled.  After months of doing so well on the Salmon/Rice food, I transitioned her onto this new food and her symptoms are re-appearing and she is not doing well.  This is a big disappointment.  I called Wellness and they said this food wasn't selling well and they changed the formulation.  Too bad - I will have to try another brand that is truly a limited ingredient diet."

I gave it a negative review because my dog, a miniature long-haired Dachshund, initially did not want to eat it. I would mix it with his old food, a good quality mostly all protein food (Orijen) that he loved--Orijen gets 6 stars at dogfoodanalysis.com, which is why I chose it. My dog would pick out the Orijen and leave the Simple Solutions in his bowl untouched.  However, my dog was getting constant ear infections that would not clear up with medication. I spent quite a bit on vet bills. I finally decided to try a different dog food to see if there was an allergy and tried Simple Solutions. As I said, initially he did not like it, but I continued to give it to him, and now he's eating it just fine.  When the Lamb & Rice almost ran out, I decided to try the Duck & Rice formula, which I'm slowly incorporating into the Lamb & Rice.  He really loves the Duck & Rice food and literally jumps up and down when he knows he going to be fed.  Also, the ear infections are completely gone.  I think this is an excellent food for dogs with sensitive stomachs or allergies, which apparently includes my dog.  I do wish some of the stores close to me would carry it though so I didn't have to purchase it online.  Fortunately, Amazon is selling it with free shipping, which was pretty fast also.<br /><br />I want to add that dogfoodanalysis.com only gives Wellness Simple Solutions 4 out of 6 stars because of the protein level, which is why I haven't given my review 5 stars. It states:<br />""Overall, we are happy with the quality of most of the ingredients in the food. The ingredient list is deliberately simple and designed for allergic dogs who may not tolerate a wide range of ingredients. We have concerns, however, at the apparently low level of meat content of the food."""

I was actually very pleased with the results of that food.  I decided to switch to the duck flavor hoping that his breath would improve.  His breath for sure has improved and has been normal for a dog, but he has had diarrhea and loose stool on it since we put him on it for the past 4 weeks.  He has also been biting his paws and itching more than he had been on the salmon flavor.  We have had to mix 1/2 a cup of the duck flavor with boiled chicken, rice, and sweet potato in order for his stools to return to normal. But at any time we feed him just this dog food, he will have extremely watery diarrhea.  Quite disappointed with this and would definitely recommend purchasing a small bag first to see if your dog can tolerate it.<br /><br />Not quite sure what we're gonna do next.

It was decent enough, but pretty bland. There weren't other options, so I searched Amazon. Amy and Brian's was a great deal compared to the bland grocery store option and had good reviews so I ordered a case.<br /><br />A couple cans came slightly dented as others have mentioned, but it clearly happened during shipping and did not compromise the product in the least. When I finally opened a can, I was so excited by the amount of pulp in it (a lot!). Even better, they had the same sweetness as the sugar added ones but with a much cleaner taste. They use Thai coconuts, which are naturally sweeter than others. I love the pulp - it's really soft, so you can easily drink without chewing it. I've got a major sweet tooth but I've been working on eating better. A cup of it after dinner or throughout the day provides just enough sweetness to curb my dessert cravings, especially taking the time to chew the pulp. I definately enjoy it more at room temp too.<br /><br />A wonderful side effect I've noticed is it helping with dry mouth!

I've actually also drank straight up from real coconuts while I was in Hawaii, South America, and Thailand as well. In my humble opinion, the country that produces and makes the best coconut water and juices is Thailand. Maybe I'm a little biased because I'm Thai American, and the majority of my relatives live in Thailand. But I've traveled to Thailand many times in my life and drank coconut water and juice beverages several times while in Thailand.

They're all pretty good - Amy and Brian, Foco, and Chaokoh have been around for a long while when it comes to coconut drinks. Foco is a Thai-based company that make many Thai exotic drinks including dragonfruit, basil seed, mangosteen, chrysanthemum, lychee, and even pennywort.

I love Boba Teas! The best use of boba pearls I've ever seen was when my sister and I visited a Yogurtology store in St. Petersburg, Florida in early June. You get your choice of frozen yogurts self-serve style, and then you put whatever toppings you want. They had different flavored boba pearls to choose from besides fresh fruit and other dessert toppings. My sister and I thought that was a great idea, putting boba pearls on top of frozen yogurt. Yogurtology is a new chain of stores based in two states so far, Arizona and Florida, and it's such a great place, that they should have this chain nationwide!) and it was the most unusual drink I've ever had so far in my life. It tasted different and unique at first, but I read on the Internet that Pennywort/Gotu Kola is supposed to be good for your body helping strengthen your immune system, reduce arthritis, and helping alleviate other health-related issues. There's even a blog on the website, Too Many Chefs, and people have been exchanging, over several years, their opinions on what they thought about Foco's Pennywort drink. I never read that blog until after I drank the Pennywort drink in February. The reason why I chose that drink is because the name caught my attention at Ha Long Bay restaurant's menu, and I'm often the curious type who always tries my best to try something new at least once. It's kind of amusing to read people's opinions on that Pennywort drink. Chaokoh, besides their coconut drink, make the best coconut milk to cook Asian and Thai meals at home. My family uses Chaokoh coconut milk all the time to cook Thai meals, and Chaokoh also sell a lot of canned Asian/Thai items such as: rambutan, longan, bamboo shoots, sugar cane, banana blossom, and jackfruit. Taste Nirvana, of course, is known for all their coconut beverages and their Thai teas and coffees. They also sell Thai chili sauce as well. And finally, Amy and Brian are known for their excellent coconut juice beverages. Amy and Brian also sell an amazing line of mangosteen juice beverages. In the end, when it comes to the best tasting Thai coconut beverages, Amy and Brian and Taste Nirvana are tied for number one. (In fact, Thai coconut water is so good that even my favorite tea company, Harney and Sons Fine Teas, currently sell Taste Nirvana products directly from their website. They admit that they love Thai coconut water and beverages. Click on Harney and Sons' bottled beverages link on their website and you will see what I mean, and Taste Nirvana is not their own brand or product! Now that's a true testament to how excellent Thai coconut water is! I'm being really truthful when I say that you haven't really tasted good coconut water or juice if you haven't tried Amy and Brian or Taste Nirvana! I've been drinking Amy and Brian's coconut juices (with and without pulp) for many years now, and the majority of coconut waters out there don't measure up to this brand (or Taste Nirvana). You truly get your money's worth when you buy Amy and Brian's drinks."

YES, too sweet and AWFUL in the small cans.","I was leery of trying the Amy & Brian's again after having this experience: AMAZING pulp-free tall cans. Horrible candy-water 10 oz cans. So, I have several cases of the short cans I refuse to drink. Awful. But I went through the cases of the tall cans. Wonderful.<br /><br />I wondered if the inconsistencies would show up in the tall cans, and I did not reorder. THEN..this big sale and sub/save showed up. Tempted me. I ordered TWO cases of this one, with the pulp.<br /><br />WONDERFUL. I like it even better than the pulp-free (which is weird, as I normally avoid pulp-containing packaged coconut water). I even found myself enjoying chewing the bits of pulp.The flavor is NOT too sweet, very nicely coconutty, not at all sour or weirdly salty like the new Zico, nicer than ONE and VitaCoco.<br /><br />So, I feel free to order more now. Clearly, there is some issue with the smaller cans. I strongly recommend you avoid those like the plague. They taste nothing like coconut water. They taste like you dropped some generic sugar candy in water and let it dissolve. Really icky sweet and NOT AT ALL coconutty. (I have had fresh out of the shell coconut water since childhood, my family being from the Caribbean, and have tasted virtually every brand available locally and on Amazon, and I know coconuts vary according to region and even harvest areas etc. Coconut water IS variable, so I don't expect homogeneous flavor. I do expect it to be coconut water and not candy water (or corn cereal milk like new Zico)). So, yeah, avoid small cans. Amy & Brian really need to look into why that stuff is disgusting, cause it's ruining their reputation whenever someone tastes that horror.<br /><br />The Tall Cans: Yes, buy these. I've sampled out of four different cases sent to me, always good. The pulp-free was more sweet compared to the tetra pak CW's I've tried, and the higher carb count makes sense. I even emailed the A&B people about it, and they said it was due to the blend/selection of coconuts that theirs is sweeter with a higher carb count. I can see how the selection could do this. I like the sweeter flavor, personally, but always have with meals cause it is higher carbs. When I want to drink coconut water by itself--I choose a lower carb variety, like original Zico was or ONE in a smaller quantity than the 17.5 ounce can.<br /><br />Thumbs up. Refreshing, sweet, coconutty, lovely. I love, love, love this coconut water in the TALL CANS.<br /><br />But I beg the Amyy & Brian folks to investigate and revamp the processing for the smaller cans. That stuff is vile and I have two cases plus sitting in my kitchen that I cannot drink. (Add that to the Zico I can't stomach and preordered and that's a lot of my money going to waste cause companies can't get it right/screw with a tried-true formula).<br /><br />Happy sipping!"

The cans seemed pretty tough, so not a single one broke, but it's unnerving imagining just how much punishment the box went through in order for them to get THAT bad.<br /><br />Also, on another note, the can itself is deceptively heavy.

I was a firm believer Vitacoco was the best until I tried Amy & Brian."
103509,B002Z08RIA,A5V7HO15N33UF,HB,2,2,5,1300665600,"No additives, good size, good price","I've tried quite a few coconut waters - all of the major brands found on Amazon in addition to imports and the like. Most canned, ""affordable"" coconut waters (generally, what you find at the Asian and Indian supermarkets) have a preservative in it which really affects the taste. No chemicals here, and yet they still manage to keep the price competitive versus the average $2.79 for 11-12 oz at the grocery!<br /><br />Judging by past personal experiences, I don't think you'll find a consistent taste in a coconut water unless the supplier mixes it all together in a giant vat or something. It's a natural product, so slight variations are to be expected. That said, I've never had a coconut water from this brand which tasted ""bad"". Just different.<br /><br />The green can has pulp, which I prefer. One reviewer who gave this a low star rating cited the inconsistency in the pulp texture - some was soft, some was harder, chewier. If you've ever cracked open a young coconut after drinking the juice to scrape the pulp out, you'll have experienced the same variations. The pulp layer within is very thin and both textures are to be expected. I don't mind it that way - it seems like more of something to expect than something to be shocked by. Don't order it expecting the pulp to be like that of oranges! Coconut pulp is its own thing.<br /><br />Great for doing yard work, sports, and as a substitute for pedialyte/gatorade when someone's ill (though this does have some natural sugar content)."

The coconut chunks varied quite a bit with quality, ranging from tender and delicious to a little too thick and tough.<br /><br />Also, almost all of my dozen 17.5 oz cans were dented in some way, with one can being a little too compromised for me to consider consumption.  After reasonably extensive storage in my refrigerator, all of the remaining coconut waters acquired a distinct, unpleasant metallic taste.  Maybe this should be expected with a tin storage container, but I certainly don't get unpleasant tastes with tetrapaks and plastic bottles after extended refrigeration.<br /><br />Despite the overall pleasant drinking experience, I doubt I will be ordering again."
103514,B002Z08RIA,A2RA4MEPFZLZF8,JSK,1,1,5,1344211200,"Yummy & refreshing taste, healthful, a little expensive!","UPDATE (10/9/12):<br /><br />I asked the company on Facebook about how much magnesium and potassium are in each can, since it is not listed even though the can advertises having lots of both (?). Their reply was ""about 676 mg Potassium and 29.12 mg Magnesium.""<br /><br />---<br /><br />It seems that coconut water is one of those love-or-hate flavors that exist in the world (kind of like avocado).  There doesn't seem to be a middle ground, either you really dislike it, or really like it.<br /><br />I'm definitely in the really-like camp. And I had to get to this brand to discover that. I had tried both <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LL0R8I"">Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UUWECC"">O.N.E. Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Aseptic Containers (Pack of 12)</a>, and found both of them insipid tasting.  But I find this brand refreshing and full of body.<br /><br />I compare the difference between ""good"" and ""bad"" coconut water to the difference between apple juice from concentrate and not from concentrate.  The former has a watery taste, like it's not the real thing, whereas the latter is more like drinking an apple.<br /><br />This brand seems more like drinking a coconut (although that's something I've never done). But it doesn't have the icky blandness to it that the above brands have.<br /><br />I also really enjoy the bits of coconut pulp, they had to the experience and taste.<br /><br />This makes a great base for powder mixes, especially flavored ones like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SG4NDI"">Vega Whole Food Shake & Go Smoothie - Tropical Tango - 300g - Powder</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SFTJD8"">Sequel Naturals Vega Shake and Go Smoothie Bodacious Berry -- 10.6 oz</a>, and even <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HI1LSI"">Garden of Life Perfect Food Raw Organic Powder Nutritional Supplement, 240 Grams</a>.<br /><br />It's also great to drink as-is, straight from the can, as both a pre- and post-hydrator.  I often drink half the can before a work-out and the other half after I'm done. If you research, it is best to pre-hydrate so your body has the extra fluids/minerals readily available as they are being depleted, rather than only hydrating after you are exhausted and dehydrated.<br /><br />This 12-pack will last you a long time, especially considering each can is two servings (~2 cups)."

While there were undoubtedly some positive tasting qualities, likely owing to good practices and Thai sourced coconuts, these were considerably overshadowed by a metallic taste. I could only say I've known this taste before in... SpaghettiO's. Texture wise the pulp was also mushier, which has the benefit of a higher ratio of the rich, buttery bits, but I'm left wanting a hint of crunch somewhere. That's to be expected from young coconuts though, sought for their fruit rather than the mature nut. I favor a mix, which I at least believe I've found in two other brands. Another problem I found was these arrived in quite bad shape, the cans were variously dinged and punched in. The other guys' cans were too, except those were pressurized and so held up better. The real drawback for me was these practically require refrigeration.

It doesnt even taste like the other Sodastream colas available (diet or regular). Most other colas will taste very similar to Coke or Pepsi, depending on which flavor profile the generic is modeling itself after.  This cola, however, tastes nothing like either and seems to have a unique flavor profile relative to the ones I've tried.  Its hard for me to pinpoint exactly what the differences are, but I believe that there is a less emphasis on the citrus flavors and more on the vanilla and cinnamon flavors.

I'd describe it as a fruitier Coke, provided that you use slightly less than the recommended portion to make the drink. And I think that's something worth mentioning: you can vary the level of sweetness by slightly altering how much of the mix you pour in to the bottle of carbonated water.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by this flavor, I would definitely buy it again."

103601,B005MSH01C,AXK7YDELIX1ZA,FotoFla,1,1,5,1349568000,It can taste really good!! But you need the right recipe!!,"This cola is really good! Yep, I gave it five stars!<br /><br />There's really only one thing to consider here, and that is cost. I'll get to that in a minute.<br /><br />So why do I think the reviews are all over the place? For one, everyone has different tastes. If we gave ""real"" Coke or Pepsi to 10 people, you will get many people who hate it. I like Pepsi Throwback myself, but to each his own. So yes, some people will hate this syrup. I'm not going to disagree with someone else's taste buds!<br /><br />But let me try to help those who have tried this and thought it wasn't very good. I can relate. Because that's what I thought at first too! Why? The answer is simple. The recipe on the bottle is really not very good.<br /><br />The recipe calls for 1 cap full of syrup and 6 ""buzzes"" of carbonation. I highly recommend you try 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cap fulls of syrup to 6 buzzes or even 7 buzzes. I like 7, but 6 was okay as well. Coke and Pepsi are VERY sweet. I thought about this, and added the extra syrup. The difference is like night and day. The additional syrup makes this taste much better to me, and much closer to what Coke tastes like.<br /><br />Now, one selling point Sodastream tries to make is cost. ""25 cents per 2 liter!"". Well this syrup, with the Natural Can Sugar, is twice the cost at major retailers of the standard Cola (the one that has Sucralose and Sugar). When you add in the extra syrup with my recommended recipe, you really aren't getting that much soda. I think I can get 6 liters of soda out of this with the new recipe. For $10 cost on the syrup alone, that's some expensive soda!<br /><br />But really, Sodastream for us is not about saving money. It's about kids and family having fun making their own soda. The novelty might wear off, sure, but we have given up worrying about the saving money part and are just enjoying the unit for the fun of creating our own sodas.<br /><br />PROS: Tastes great. Made only with natural sugars.<br /><br />CONS: Recipe needs to be altered to taste. If you use more syrup like I do, you aren't saving money versus buying Coke or Pepsi.<br /><br />Bottom line: this syrup tastes good if you alter the recipe and make your soda sweeter than called for on the bottle. If you aren't concerned with saving money on your soda and just with having fun with your creations, this is still a good buy."

What do you respond with?  If your answer is ""Sure, Pepsi will do,"" or something along those lines, then you'll find this SodaStream Natural Cola syrup to be just fine.  It is not a Coca-Cola substitute.  It is along the lines of Pepsi in the glass bottle from Mexico which is made with cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup.  It's not as good as Pepsi hecho en Mexico, but it's not gross and disgusting like others make it out to be.<br /><br />I enjoy craft pop like most people enjoy craft beer.  Some of it is awesome, like Coke from Mexico and many of the Boylan and Goose Island flavors, and a lot of it isn't too good, like the under-mixed, under-flavored store brands that are only marginally less expensive than the national brands.  Being that this is my first experience with home-mixed pop, I'm delighted that it was much better than a store-brand.<br /><br />Mixing pop at home is not more economical than buying a case of Coke when it's on sale, but it certainly is a lot more fun, it's ""greener,"" and you get to try a ton more flavors than you're used to.  It is about the same price as pop from the specialty items section, however, so if you're the explorer type, then you'll enjoy trying new syrups."

If you find it is a touch sweet, you can a. try using a little less syrup! And honestly, I suggest that you try this anyway because the cap this bottle comes with is huge. Or, b. try using more CO2 when you are carbonating your water. If neither of these suit you then c. doing both should help a lot.<br /><br />I like this flavour a lot. If you really want the closest thing to Coca Cola, this is as close as you will get without spending more for a huge cannister of actual Coca Cola syrup, the kind sold to stores and restaurants. For the price, I think most people will find this more suitable.<br /><br />As a final note I will say that although I love this flavour, I tend to prefer the other Cola syrup, the one that comes in a white bottle--even if only for its lower price.

Muddy it up with something like flavored syrup (cherry, vanilla, etc) or Rum and it isn't as noticeable.<br /><br />Also remember that with cola and other ""dark"" syrups, you have to increase the level of carbonation.

Very finely ground, no lumps at all, very fresh and always come in perfect packaging.<br /><br />The color of it seems almost white when the flour is raw but as you cook it, for some reason it becomes a whole lot darker. Even a tiny bit of it gives to any dish a strong blueberry-like color. That can sometimes look a bit unattractive if you are cooking for others. I made for instance a broccoli soup with broccoli, potatoes, chicken broth and I used this flour to thicken it. I only added a very tiny bit of flour, for a big pot of soup, but the whole thing turned dark purple. Now I guess a dark purple soup does not exactly match what most people would expect a broccoli - potato soup to look like lol. But fortunately I just cooked it for myself and I'm not really picky about how the food looks.<br /><br />It also holds a very strong, somewhat bitter taste. A little bit of this flour will not only be very visible in any dish but also you will be able to clearly taste the black beans. I was using Bob's Red Mill garbanzo flour before this, and that one, instead, had a very mild flavor and a very pale color.<br /><br />Personally, I will not buy this flour again because the color and especially the flavor are a bit too much for me (I will probably go back to the garbanzo flour or the white beans flour), but I still give 5 stars because I think it is the best you can realistically expect from a black bean flour."

It smelled ""toastier"" as it was popping than other popcorns we've tried.  We tried it all different ways, with toppings ranging from sweet to savory and every way was good.<br /><br />We also liked the fact that it is grown by Amish people and are happy to support their efforts to raise their crops the ""old way.""  They believe in sustainable farming and a clean, wholesome way of life.  No ConAgra multi-national conglomerates here, just real, individual farmers making a living off their land.<br /><br />Great products raised and produced by real farmers.  What better reasons do you need to buy some of this really tasty popcorn!?"

Purchased this item in June 2011 and placed it in our kitchen cupboard upon arrival.  Two weeks ago, we were watching a movie and decided to have some popcorn.  Grabbed the new bag of Wabash (purple) and opened it.  Moths came flying out of the bag.  Yes, moths!!  Quickly closed the bag and to our dismay saw many, many moths crawling around inside the bag.  Did some internet research and found the moths are called Indian Meal Moths.  We have never seen these critters in our kitchen before and are sure they came with the popcorn.  We did a complete clean out of our cupboards and have not found them in any other products.  We wrote an email to Wabash Valley thru Amazon about this incident two weeks ago and have heard nothing back.  We would have thought they would pony up and at least offer an apology, if not a complete refund.  We realize that this kind of thing happens and are saddened by their lack of response and responsibility.  It's just not good business.  They have our money after all."

It came in a clear plastic bag with the pretty red label.  Very colorful corn - lots of dark red with a few kernels of white mixed in.  As some of the other reviewers have said, for a hot air popper, you'll definitely want to tip the popper backward the minute you plug it in or else the air pressure will send kernels flying around your kitchen like schrapnel.  Trust me - you'll be ducking for cover and then finding kernels for the next year or so.  I did not let go of my hot air popper until there was a good amount of popped corn to weigh down the unpopped kernels.  These kernels are noticeably smaller than others you'll see in the grocery store so when they pop, the end result is smaller.  If you have shag carpet, this is probably not a good thing.  The husks are softer and tend to cause less damage to your gums if they get caughtin your teeth, though it won't happen often.  The cost for this little bag is also significantly higher than we'd want to pay again.  Another big con for us is the number of unpopped kernels that remain - probably 1 - 2 dozen per 1/2 cup batch.  For the cost, that's too much.  We'll be trying something else next time."

It's great to have a portable snack that my chemically-sensitive kids can eat. These are going to be great to bring on picnics, to the park, on car trips, etc.<br /><br />The biggest quibble I have is that the ""snack-size"" bags are a little too large for younger kids (pre-schoolers or kindergartners) to finish at one sitting. If I send a bag in with my kindergartner for snack time, even though he loves them he can't finish them all. About 1.5 oz would be plenty for young kids.<br /><br />Ironically, they are cheaper per ounce in the snack size bags than in the larger boxes.

Flavor is such a subjective thing that I hate to down-rate a high quality product too much just on that basis. But I won't be ordering any more of these.<br /><br />My oldest son says they don't have enough cinnamon to achieve a strong cinnamon flavor, but too much to achieve just a hint of cinnamon flavor. I think they actually have the right amount of cinnamon, but aren't quite sweet enough, especially on the exterior. They just come across a little bit bland. I know a lot of people say that is just because people are used to over-sweetened foods, but I think the chocolate chip flavor Snackimals have just the right amount of sweetness.

My mom and Granny always used Lipton loose leaf. As an adult I started short cutting with tea bags and they were OK.  Years ago I started buying Snapple bottled tea with Raspberry, Lemon, or Peach flavors. They are a delicious change but a bit expensive. I moved and Snapple is not available here. So I started buying powdered flavored instant teas. Nasty! I was on a mission if Snapple could do it, so could I.<br />I wanted the great flavor of home brewed tea and I sometimes want it to be flavored. I bought a Mr Coffee Iced Tea Maker for the ease of use. I bought Loose leaf Lipton tea because that is what I was weaned on. 1 bought the 4 cup paper coffee filters as they fit the tea maker perfectly. I've tried several products and Torani Syrups are the best and reasonably priced. I now make great flavored tea that is as good, if not better, than any I've ever bought anywhere.<br />I use the Tea Maker now according to Mr Coffee instructions using ¼ cup Lipton loose leaf tea. I use ½ cup of sugar and ½ cup of Torani Raspberry or Peach syrup. Oh Baby! Great tea!

Torani makes an excellent product.  The one thing I would say to somebody buying for the first time would be to play around with measurements.  It's very easy to go overboard with the flavor.

I vowed never to buy commercial pasta sauces ever again, but this certainly changed my mind. This is very close to making a sauce from scratch, in my opinion.

I have tried other brands of ready to eat Indian foods such as Jyoti and Tasty Bite. This brand compares favorably and I do plan on buying this exact product again. It is not overly hot but is spicey - so while it may be a bit much for some children, adults should do fine.<br /><br />As these types of vegetarian items (or near veggie since some of the sampler includes paneer cheese which is like cubes of tofu but with a cheesy taste), are highly pureed in texture, except when there are beans, they can be used as sauces over rice, shell pasta, quinoa, couscous, polenta, potatoes, etc.  The bean ones could be heated and used in lieu of soup or chili for lunch with a crusty french bread for instance. Would pair great with a fresh salad.<br /><br />Product is excellent for those looking for all those great spices like cumin, curry, tumeric, peppers, and the like. Also qualifies as a whole food.<br /><br />Highly portable since packaged in tear away foil packets which are light weight and could be eaten out of them in a pinch if don't mind your fingers getting a bit messy reaching in and out of the foil to spoon out the food. I don't recommend trying to eat with a fork as even the bean ones are in sauces. Foil packages are not for the microwave but product eats fine at room temperature.

But on occasion I will have some cheese, butter, and milk here and there if they are included in something that I did not make myself. That being said, when I am 'bad' I want it to be GOOD! However...I honestly like the taste of the ones without the dairy products so much better.<br /><br />And I am Italian, so I definitely used to have a special place in my heart for cheese, but the cottage cheese ones were kinda off.<br /><br />The mashed vegetable one (which contains butter) was just ok.<br /><br />So to review, in order...best to least:<br /><br />Rajma Masala - Red Kidney Bean Curry<br />Pindi Chana-Chick Pea Cu<br />Dal Bukara - Black Lentil Curry<br />Navratan Korma - Mixed Vegetable & Cottage Cheese Curry<br />Jpav Bhaji - Mashed Vegetable Curry<br /><br />Notice I didn't place Palak Paneer- Spinach w/Cottage Cheese on the list?? That's because it was NASTY! Definitely didn't like this one. I mean, It wasnt so bad that I threw it away. I still ate it, but I wont ever buy the Spinach one again.<br /><br />Don't let me sway your decision to buy Kitchens of India products though. The ones I did like tasted better than most Indian restaurants I have been to. And I've been to quite a few. Not to mention it is much cheaper than going out to a restaurant by far!<br /><br />And if you live on the north eastern USA and have a Wegmans near you, they just started making different kinda of packaged Naan breads which are also very good (they are not vegan though sadly).<br /><br />I've ordered a 6 pack of the Kidney Bean curry, lentil curry, and chick pea curry because I liked them so much. And thankfully out of the 6 choices in this multi pack, the 3 that I like the best have the lowest amount of fat and sodium, which seem to be very high in all of Kitchens of India products. Especially the Sodium. So be careful, and eat them in moderation as I do.<br /><br />Hope this helps!"

Simple as that.If your new to Indian food, this stuff is fairly authentic and very tasty for a prepackaged meal. stick it in the microwave for about 60-65 seconds and your done. i suggest putting some rice on the side and perhaps some naan bread and you are all set. my only warning to newbies is the pindi chana is considered ""very spicy"" (I am used to it so it has no effect on me by now). All the other dishes are simply very tasty.<br /><br />One thing i want to point out is, the salt content in almost all indian food is super high so if you have high blood pressure this is not for you.<br /><br />I only eat about one package a week due to the high salt content but would indulge more if they offered a lower sodium version.<br /><br />Thanks to Kitchens Of India (the other companies such as tasty bite are ok, but nothing compared to this company)!<br /><br />Ps. they are hard to find in most supermarkets and now that i discovered amazon carries them.... well that's the end of that search!"

I tried to make Palak Paneer before, and it didn't work out.  So until I can get in that Indian Cooking class, I resort to pre-made or take out for a fix.<br /><br />All of the varieties in this pack are good.  Some are better than others, the only one that is lack luster is the Palak Paneer.  The down side to these is that they contain a lot of your daily salt intake.  The upside is that they don't have to be refrigerated, you get a good variety and they are fast to make.  If you pre-cook some rice, you can just put some in a bowl, pour the contents of the pouch on top and pop in the microwave for a minute or so and you're read to eat.  And with fresh cooked rice, just dump it on, the heat from the rice will warm it up.<br /><br />Warning:  Besides the Palak Paneer, I would characterize these a fairly spicy for Western gullets.  If you suffer from anything thing that precludes spicy foods, I'd stay away, most of this is probably nothing you want to deal with.<br /><br />I'm actually not ordering this anymore because I have tried to cook more myself and these were making it too easy to just say screw it.<br /><br />Dal Bukara - Black Lentil Curry - this is good, not much of a lentil fan until I had this.<br />Palak Paneer- Spinach w/Cottage Cheese - just so-so, cheese is not consistent, no real mph to it.<br />Rajma Masala - Red Kidney Bean Curry - I do not like kidney beans, but I love this, this one is a little spicy.<br />Navratan Korma - Mixed Vegetable & Cottage Cheese Curry - Good, again, the cheese is not great, but better than the Palak<br />Jpav Bhaji - Mashed Vegetable Curry, - super good, spicy.<br />Pindi Chana-Chick Pea Curry - I love this one with the chickpeas.<br /><br />The kidney beans and the chick peas really reminded me of chili.

Also, if you're concerned about portions, you'll want to know that the packet is more than one official serving, but it is so good that I usually have it all for one meal. The spinach paneer is just a bit less flavorful and spicy than the other dishes, but if you're in the mood for something a little more toned down, it's perfect. It was fun to go through the different kinds and flavors to see which ones I like the best.

Well the shipment came quickly (as always) and I was excited to share these great flavors with my trailermates, mongo and eugene. Mongo was in (he always is when it invloves food), but eugene was going off to a local comic book show because he wanted to get an autograph from one of the original borgs from some star trek show. Anyhoo I decided to make mongo the pav bhaji and myself the palak paneer. I loved my and mongo had eatten his before I even sat down. He screamed ""more! more!"" And started to beat his head on the table so to stop him I quickly put together the pindi chana and he scarfed that down too. As I was cleaning up mongo started to hold his stomach and make gurgling sounds. He wheeled himself into the bathroom and for the next two hours I only heard what sounded like his intestines giveing up what ever that had stored in there. I actually left because my trailer started to smell too bad. While outside I realized that mongo had irritable bowel syndrome and the indian food must have. fired that up. Wow let me tell you I made sure to wait until eugene showed up to clean up the mess that mongo made before I reappeared. At least I had some good paneer tonight"

I have not been drinking as much alcohol as I was during Football season so I know that might be a factor.<br /><br />Bottom line is that I know anything could have caused the weight loss but the only thing that I have done drastically different is drink 1-2 cups of this tea per day.

104016,B0010BQB6A,A3VTBY1F2KM3SE,JSK,2,3,4,1344643200,Good oolong for the price,"This review is for PoP Oolong tea bags. My tea background was first drinking Indian milk tea using black loose tea, milk, spices, and sugar. I added far-Eastern teas (non-milk varieties) in my search for a quicker tea to brew (milk tea needs more time to prepare). I am on my 3rd box of PoP Oolong tea. The tea is not like black or green teas. Be prepared for a bitter taste but with a sweeter aftertaste. Like black teas, this produces some kind of coating feeling on the tongue, almost similar to eating an unripened banana. It is somewhat woody in taste and smell (maybe a bit flowery. It may also be slightly sour, but less than some green teas. I have tried whole leaf oolong from a Chinese shop and that was more like green tea. If you can afford more expensive oolong teas, then you might get better quality. For the price, you're getting a good deal. I also think that the batches vary so sometimes you might get a stronger, bitter flavor but if you experiment with the brewing, you might get your desired flavor.<br /><br />To brew this PoP Oolong tea, realize that ground tea in bags will release their flavors much faster. My solution is to boil some filtered water. After bringing to a boil, I turn off the stove and add 1 cup (237 mL) hot water to the tea bag. Then wait ~30 seconds (or golden brown color appears)and remove the bag. The first cup usually extracts most of the caffeine and is the most bitter and strong taste. Now I can brew with another cup of the hot water. I can brew around 4 cups with the colors being golden brown, golden, light green, and very light green. It is best to brew by the color and not the time. If you leave the bag in too long, it will be terribly bitter.<br /><br />Tea brewing is an art and science, as many other things in life are. Please refer to the science of solvent extraction for a better idea. Basically, you are extracting the tea's aromatic compounds into the water. The flavor of the brew are mainly affected by water quality, extraction time (the time in water), and water temperature. You have to experiment with this for your preferred flavor. Sugar is absolutely not necessary, if prepared correctly."

This is the real deal.  From that hot volcanic rock off the coast of Sicily, Pantalleria, these are capers to provoke a caper of your own.  I found them in Italy. Five stars for Pantalleria capers which go with caviar.<br /><br />These are the most intensely flavored buds in the business. I use these salted capers in sauces including a lemon caper butter sauce for my veal.  Using only the salt that clings to them, the sauce is stunning and different from sauce using other caper brands that are not Pantalleria or are stored in oil. Brine is the enemy and additives other than salt distort the flavor. For most dishes, you will rinse away the salt, or save it, because whatever you made is already salted. But beware, you kill capers if you cook them. Just add the capers after you turn the heat off. The heat from a warm pan is plenty.<br /><br />I'll admit, these are more expensive.  You can get good capers in salt from elsewhere including some nice Spanish ones.  I will use those more often.  But for special service, I reach for these.  Nice to have them available here."

The full line up of A & P coffees was: yellow bag: Eight O'Clock; red bag: Red Circle; black bag: Bokar.  That order represented the relative strength of the respective blends.  Fortunately for coffee lovers, after A & P spun off their coffee line into a company called Compass Foods, the coffee operation was purchased by Tata Tea (a subsidiary of the larger Tata Group).  Sometime earlier, the yellow bag blend was dropped, and Eight O'Clock name was appended to the mid-level blend.  The black bag now represents the varietal offering of Columbian beans.  Another hallmark of Eight O'Clock is its consistency from bag to bag, month to month, and year to year: A true testament to the blending and roasting skills of the manufacturer.

My guests' compliments ensured my loyalty to this company.<br /><br />However, for about the last year I've noticed that the taste has changed for the worse.

What I've concluded is that this is a great coffee at a great price for coffee drinkers who aren't particularly discriminating in their coffee tastes (especially if you doctor it up with plenty of cream and sugar, as we tend to do). Honestly, we thought this coffee was perfect until we traveled to Panama and tasted real fresh-roasted, mountain grown coffee. After that, coming home to Eight O'Clock wasn't so great. But if you are already drinking pre-ground coffee, and don't have a particular brand preference, I'm guessing you'll be totally happy with this product.

One more thing, if you use CO2 filters in your coffee vault like I do, the Eight O'clock brand has one in each bag. When I open a new bag to put in my coffee vault I take the CO2 filter out of the bag and replace the CO2 filter in the vault. Doing this not only keeps the coffee fresh it saves money because you don't have to keep buying replacement CO2 filters... They're not exactly cheap.

I tried a variety of lower priced coffees, different roasts, flavors, etc.  I prefer a milder, less acidic taste, and surprisingly I thought it was the best.  My favorite up to that point was Dunkin Donuts whole bean medium roast, but the price was going higher everytime I purchased it. I was on a quest to brew a great cup that tastes similar to what we find in a diner, at a lower price and this fit the bill perfectly.  Eight O'Clock is a mild but full bodied flavor, with less acidity and no bitterness.  Very drinkable with or without cream.  Since higher acid in coffee sometimes upsets my stomach, I thought I might have to stop drinking it altogether.  For the best cup, I always grind my own beans, and recently switched from a drip maker to a percolator.  Since this is an old fashioned favorite, I think the percolator is appropriate. I still grind the beans, and prepare the percolator the night before (just like I did with my automatic timer Mr. Coffee) and plugged the percolator into a light timer set for my early morning time.  That way, my coffee is still ready for me when I'm still half asleep.  My husband, who always used half-and -half in his coffee, now drinks Eight O'Clock black.

I was blown away!  I recognized the name as something of a throwback from decades past, probably my grandmother would remember this coffee brand, and at this price, it was worth a gamble.  I bought four of them.<br /><br />My motto is, how bad can you screw up the coffee, if you can grind the whole beans yourself, and the beans haven't been sitting there for a couple of years?  Even the cheapest coffee, if roasted minimally and ground fresh by me, tastes better then the most expensive coffee, that is pre-ground, sitting on a shelf for a few months.  There is no comparison, fresh ground always crushes, pun not intended, pre-ground.<br /><br />So back to this Eight O'Clock whole-bean coffee I got on sale.  I use my electric grinder, which is the typical handheld electric grinder, and I top it off with the Eight O'Clock beans, which is the normal amount, grind it, and throw it in my french coffee press, add the nearly boiling water, press it, and pour myself a cup.  Oh yea, I add heavy whipping cream, instead of half and half, because I'm watching my carbs.<br /><br />What can I say? Coffee is great.  It's different from the Starbucks burnt flavor, cause I have Starbucks wholebean as well.  Eight O'Clock has a hint of sweetness, I'm pretty sure that several local restaurants must use Tata for coffee, because it has a similar flavor.  It's obvious that it's not as heavily roasted as Starbucks, but what is?<br /><br />Anyway, after reading the negative reviews here, I'm not sure if there's a quality control issue, a bad batch, or if there is some counterfeit coffee being sold ....whatever the problem is, I know I won't be buying this Eight O'Clock coffee online.  I trust my local grocer if  run into a bad batch to take it back.<br /><br />I'm going back tonight to buy out the rest of their Eight O'Clock."

However, I have always had one problem.<br /><br />I prefer to drink lattes with soy milk.  Not only do I prefer not to have so much dairy, but I find they taste better, when it is a quality, appropriate soy milk.  I had tried many soy milks at the grocery store.  However, I always found that they did not froth/steam well.  They turned out tasting awful, and these soy milks from other companies had what Pacific Natural Foods call a ""beany,"" taste.  They specifically say their product does not have this ""beany taste.""  For the most part, I agree.<br /><br />It's a good tasting product.  I was a bit scared about the vanilla, but I really do not detect vanilla in the latte.  I get a bit of aftertaste, but when it's a good latte, the espresso tends to override any slight deficiency in this product.<br /><br />It holds up very nicely to steaming and produces a great forth.<br /><br />Without question, this is the best soy milk I have ever steamed myself.

Tried different soy milks, from Silk to Kirkland's. Nothing. We also tried Almond milk, which I read would froth. Well, Froth they did. But it wasn't a soft velvety, wet-paint, microfoam.

Your smaller grocery chains, Target, Walgreens, etc will not have it. They only<br />want to carry the Creamy Pasta and Creamy Broccoli varieties for some reason. Why this is the case makes no sense. When I was growing up tetrazzini was the favorite flavor in our house and you could always find it at the store. Betty Crocker has been making some baffling changes to the Helper line like refusing to put microwave directions on the box (check online if you need them), making flavors harder to find, and reducing the amount of noodles in certain varieties.

IMO, Swiss Licorice has the richest, deepest, truest black licorice flavor of the 4 commercial GF black Licorice products I've tried (others: OrgraN, Belgian, Allen's).  It's even better than my homemade attempts at GF black licorice.<br /><br />Swiss Licorice is a total taste bliss-out.  It melts slowly, with each piece giving a lengthy gustatory experience.  IME, the slow-melting, big taste aspect of Swiss Licorice make it economical.  I don't find, as with other brands, that I need to gobble more and more of it.<br /><br />Swiss Licorice is a not a high-sugar product, IMO.  It also has some fiber, courtesy of acacia gum.  Possibly the combination of these 2 factors contributes to the ""satisfying"" (no need to binge) aspect.<br /><br />This product is less chewy than some of the other brands.  I thought I'd miss that, however the flavor & long-lastingness of Swiss Licorice trump chew, IMO.<br /><br />If you love black licorice, you owe it to yourself to try this product.  It's great for both regular black licorice fanatics, as well as celiac / gluten-intolerant black licorice devotees.<br /><br />Now if the Chateau could only come up with  the GF equivalent of cherry Nibs ..."

There used to be a small candy shop just outside of Chicago that used to make a similar product.  However, due to the destruction of a tree where one of the ingredients was harvested, the shop stopped making the licorice, permanently.  This product is the closest product I have found to the one made at that candy shop.  It is a combination of hard candy until it is moistened; then it becomes the consistency of a very tough jelly bean.  If you do not chew the licorice and allow it to dissolve, it wii last a long time."

Highly recommended for the best licorice experience.<br />I'm not sure why someone said these were stale and stuck together.  They sell so fast you sometimes have to wait while more are made and shipped to Amazon.  Probably someone who dislikes everything.  On a scale from 1 to 10 these are a 20.  In fact these are so superior to other licorice that there is no comparison to be made.  I've tried just about all types, too.

I have purchased many different types of black licorice from Amazon and feel this licorice is definitely overrated and overpriced.  It tastes good but it's definitely not worth $17.00 a pound.  The licorice is hard and does stick to your teeth if you chew it.  There are many other black licorice products, at a third of the price, that taste as good or better.  This is Swiss Licorcie made in the USA--not sure why it commands such a high price.  I recommend you try the German Haribo licorice wheels or the Finska licorice ripples, they are not hard licorice but they have a great flavor!"

It was smooth and rich with a wonderful caramel finish I had never experienced before. Since then I have had five other batches from two different vendors. Each of these later coffees were very disappointing. One vendor even sent a replacement bag (worth $80) after I gave a negative review to ""renew your faith in Kopi"". But I have never had a Kopi Luwak as good as that first one. When I am going to spend this amount of money on coffee, or anything else for that matter, I'm going to need to know I am getting consistent quality of product and that is definitely not the case here. I just received a 100 gram bag as a gift from a friend and it was the most disappointing of all. I get better Sumatran coffee from my local roaster for $12 lb.

Finally, in 3 to 5 minutes when you drink your tea, you'll start to realize while no other green chai tea will ever measure up again. This is the best - truly, therapy in a cup. But please note: if you're not used to chai tea, it may take a few cups to get used to - I think it's a little stronger than other chai. The traditional way to drink this is with sweetener and a little milk, although I prefer mine with just hot water.

Secondly, I received the Grilled Chicken and Pasta not the Grilled Chicken Parm.<br /><br />As such, this review is for the Grilled Chicken and Pasta.<br /><br />The sauce, like all of Hormel's red pasta sauces, is on the sweet side with a tang of too much acidity. I find both are easily rectified with something spicy added (I opted for some red pepper flakes for this which helped a lot but I've also tried hot sauce and sriracha chili sauce with others and they work just as well). The spaghetti is cut into short and stubby strips which makes it easy to eat but bothered me for some odd reason. As for the chicken, I found half to be extremely dry and almost unpalatable and the other half to be perfectly fine.<br /><br />All in all, the grilled chicken and pasta is one of the average meals for Hormel. There's nothing horrible about it but then again, there's nothing completely great about it as well. If you need something that doesn't need to be refrigerated, can be heated up extremely quickly, and don't mind lots and lots of sodium (900mg for this one which is on the low end for Hormel), you can't go horribly wrong with this meal. Of course, if you're expecting the taste of something homemade, you're going to hate this.

104279,B0016512YG,A1WT1RLV6KTMY2,Current Resident,3,5,1,1336780800,Loaded with sugars and contains undeclared fats; not a health food,"People, learn how to read nutrition labels. Servings are typically divided into just one or two cookies. Two cookies contain about 100 calories, 24 g carbohydrates and 14 g sugars. The calorie breakdown is over 90% carbohydrates, mostly from sugars. This is a BIG red flag. No one should consume junk like this. Don't be misled by the ""Fat Free"" label. (see second paragraph) Refined sugars are far, far worse for dieters than fats are; poly- and monounsaturated fats are in fact beneficial, and calories from fat provide more stable energy. With the exception of trans and saturated fats, (they raise bad cholesterol) you really shouldn't be on a low-fat diet. Sugars are the worst thing for dieters, as they aren't as likely to be metabolized as energy, and will typically be stored as body fat. (mostly around the mid-section) High-fructose corn syrup (an ingredient in SnackWell's products) is specifically linked with an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. The human body simply is not meant to metabolize this much sugar, nor sugars that are unnaturally processed. I can't provide links to research on the subject, because Amazon has rather ridiculous policies that censor URLs, names of other sites, stores, competitors, etc. from reviews. Be sure to complain to Amazon.com about this practice. Still, it's easy enough to open a search engine and type ""snackwell devil food nutrition facts"" or the like.<br /><br />Bear in mind that products are not required to declare nutritional content when the servings are divided into small portions, and the content would be less than 0.5 g. Each cookie actually contains 0.17 g saturated fat, which Nabisco neglects to mention. Trans fat content is entirely unaccounted for, though it may actually exist. This means that ""Fat Free"" claim was just a blatant lie. Will anyone hold Nabisco responsible for unscrupulously deceiving consumers, though? Can anyone demand that they pull misleading products off the shelf? Nope. Welcome to corporate America.<br /><br />Don't let Nabisco and other ""health-conscience"" snack companies scam you. Read labels closely, and be suspicious of small servings. If a single serving contains less than 0.5 g trans fat, then it doesn't have to be declared; the label will inaccurately specify 0 g. If the portions seem ridiculously small, then it's safe to assume they're trying to hide something from the consumer.<br /><br />On a side note, please ignore ""helpful review"" ratings. Re-distributors of products will often vote down critical reviews, because they demote the very products they're trying to sell on Amazon. It's all politics."

The original was a glowing review but apparently I'm not allowed to review the same product twice. Really Amazon? This jerky used to be so good and now it's the weirdest ever. The packaging that used to be so easy to open is now impossible without scissors. The jerky itself is like squares of hard rubber that are nearly impossible to chew.I bought my usual boxes of original and teriaki and the flavors were almost identical. After years of being a fan (especially my husband who doesn't eat beef)I'm so disappointed in whoever is responsible for destroying a great product. To whoever designed the new packaging....you need to go back to the drawing board. How about the original? It was perfect on all counts as it was. From 5 stars to 1. Barely.

I realize turkey breast meat has lower fat and a stringier, low-connective-tissue makeup, but this stuff is just not enjoyable to eat.

I tasted these chips expecting a basic tortilla chip with a hint of flavor, which is what I am used to tasting. The flavor was stronger than subtle and the chips were utlra-fresh tasting. Straight up, here's the pros and cons:<br />PROS: Super fresh. Nice portion size, especially because you'll want more than one portion. Attractive on a plate, unlike traditional tortilla chips. Good amount of flavoring. Light, not greasy. Chips were sturdy and didn't crumble in the bag easily. No pile of ""chip-lets"" at the bottom. Would probably be a nice surprise in someone's lunch box or at a movie party or summer get-together.<br /><br />CONS: Probably not great for dipping. If you're an olive lover, you may prefer the flavor to be more potent, as I did. If you're concerned about packaging waste, there's a lot of extra bag here which seems wasteful.<br /><br />I personally felt the olive flavor could have been stronger, so I withheld one star, but that is my personal taste. Several people felt it was strong enough. They are definitely worth trying."

With that being said, it's a corn chip that has olive flavor. There are specks of olive in the chip, but being it's a corn chip to start with, it's hard to recognize them. The taste is distinctly ""olive"" and the salt content is just about right for my taste. I tend to like my chips a bit on the salty side. They have a good amount of ""crunch"".<br /><br />I can't say whether I'd purchase them again. I suppose if the price was right I would. However, I have issues paying a premium for junk food. You can dress it up in a nice bag, put a great name on it, but it's still junk food- it's a corn chip.

If so, FoodShouldTasteGood's line of nutritious tortilla chips strikes an effective balance between satisfying your junk food cravings while providing some nutritional benefit by way of high quality ingredients and a few grams of fiber to boot.<br /><br />The most important factor though is that with their 'Olive' line of tortilla chips (think of a white corn tortilla chip with flavor profiles of black and green olives and a hit of garlic) the taste itself is good enough to convince the staunchest junk-food addicts to reach into that bag for yet another bite.  These chips go well with everything from sandwiches to soups as well as served plain by itself.

The size and shape of the chips (more like crackers than larger tortilla chips) was good for snacking, plus the thickness provided just the right texture and ""crunch"" factor.<br /><br />Later I finished the chips with a pesto dip and the complementary flavors worked perfectly: the chip didn't over power the dip, but neither did it roll over and die. I am sure I would enjoy these tortilla chips with other dips.<br /><br />Finally a last observation is how well these mini-chips kept their original shape.

The sesame seed flavor really pops after a few bites and they aren't dry in your mouth like some other multigrain products. They are a tad stale feeling, but I think that's intended and it doesn't mean they're old. With that said, I enjoyed my first bag. If I see these in a local store I will buy them again."

That's not a bad thing since I would chose them over other chips- they're just not a 'must have'.  Flavor is good, multi-layered in that you can pretty much taste the individual ingredients - the oat bran, the grains.  Salt level is good.  To compare, Tostitos regular tortilla chips can be extremely salty, whereas these are not.  Flavor is also more dimensional than the Tostitos multi-grain chips (but not that far apart); the ingredients are obviously much better.  They do look nice with their textured nuts and such in them, so they would look much better than your average chip if you were hosting a nice party."

This multi-grain chips may be packed with goodness, but they taste like a stale wheat thin that was left sitting in a bag of real tortilla chips for awhile and managed to pick up a bit of their flavor.  I think I would actually like these better if they were simple multi-grain crackers without the thin brushing of flavoring.<br /><br />Someone looking for a healthy alternative might be happy with these.  If you are a compulsive snacker, then maybe you could get used to the taste.  But anyone looking to chow down on some tortilla chips isn't going to be too happy, and would have to force themselves through a bag of these rather than eating what they really wanted.<br /><br />Unless you covered them with cheese and made nachos.

These light crisp tortilla chips have a subtle flavor of green olives with just a hint of garlic -- nothing at all overpowering, but you know it's there.  The flavor combination -- the brininess of the olives with the garlic -- is just right.<br /><br />They're not too salty, either -- a major complaint I have with a lot of chips.  Seems as if other manufacturers feel that in order to get flavor, you have to go heavy on the salt.  Not these.  An entire bag has just 80 mg of sodium.<br /><br />For folks on Weight Watchers, an entire snack-size bag comes to 3 pts.  Add some nice fresh salsa (tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalapenos, salt/pepper to taste), and you have a filling healthy snack.  Or how about some light semi-soft cheese, the kind that comes in the little individually-wrapped wedges?  These chips are sturdy enough to serve as light crackers.

However, stone ground yellow corn is clearly the main ingredient in these chips and you'll have a hard time picking up the flavor of the other ingredients with your taste buds.<br /><br />The other thing I really like about these chips is that they're flavored with sea salt, which is lower in sodium and (in my opinion) tastes better than regular table salt.

I think they'd go really well with a fresh fruit salad.  They'd go well with ice cream, and they're perfect with a tart, plain yogurt.  I dipped them in hummus too, and while it doesn't not work...I'm not sure it's great.  Still, basically they're versatile and not too bad for you.

I'm a fan of spicy food so I had to test these out for myself.  The chips do not smell spicy at all which means they are spiced properly (not overloaded).  Upon first bite you might not taste much but that is when this chip gets you.  Very quickly a subtle jalapeno flavor kicks in with a bit of nice spice that isn't to overpowering.<br /><br />With the added kick of the chips these would go perfect with a nice mild salsa.  The chips are crispy and fresh, with that nice subtle spice lingering on your taste-buds for a good few minutes so a small 1.5oz bag will last you some time and allow you to savor the flavor."

But with the bag just opened that moment, and an expiration date over a year in advance, I'm apt to believe that this is just how they're supposed to be.

If you are watching your calories and fat, it is great that they list the nutritional information for the whole bag and not for 1/2 bag like some companies do.  All the ingredients in these chips are ones that you see on those lists of ""healthy foods you should be eating.""  All the flavors meld together to make a really nice, rich flavor that is ever-so-slightly sweet, and you get a light taste of flax and sesame seeds.<br /><br />I compared the label with Doritos Toasted Corn Tortilla Chips, and these Multigrain Chips have 3 times the fiber, 2/3 the sodium, 1/2 the saturated fat, and of course the much healthier ingredients, with no trans fats.<br /><br />These are the best chips of the many I have tried that use healthy ingredients, and I'll be definitely ordering more of them."

Just the right amount of crunch.  These chips aren't overly salty, either, another plus.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise, these chips rank among the more healthy versions.  There are only 140 calories in a one ounce serving, a lot less than the normal 200+ I see on similar products, and the amount of fat and sodium is a lot lower, too. It's got 3g of fiber = 11% of an average daily requirement. There are no trans fats cholesterol, preservatives, etc.  It seems that the FoodShouldTasteGood company made a sincere effort to produce as healthy a product as was possible given the ingredients and requirement to make something that tastes good.<br /><br />One reviewer said the chips were too hard and tasted stale.  My own experience was that the chips tasted fresh and were crunchy but by no means any harder or crunchier than a regular tortilla chip.  The expiration date on the bag is in November.  With no preservatives, it seems odd that the bag the other reviewer tried had an expiration date more than a year away.<br /><br />My only hesitation would be the price.  Currently these chips aren't in stock on Amazon and there is no pricing given so I would say you'd have to evaluate whether or not you wanted to pay that much for chips, even though they seem better for your health than other brands and they taste good, as well."

The singular bag is made of a relatively thick foil-like material and is air puffed tightly.  The result is freshly crisp, unbroken chips in the bag.  A nice bonus and much better than standard lunch-sized chip bags you find from most common companies.<br /><br />As for the taste of the chips, they're pretty good.  I liked the olive and garlic flavor when I was eating them by themselves.  However, when I paired them with some salsa, the olive taste didn't match up that well.  They might go better with a french onion chip dip instead (though I didn't try that).<br /><br />So if you want fresh, never-broken tortilla chips to eat just by themselves with no dip, these do rather well.

But maybe the thickness of the packaging and the tight seal at the top is to keep in the freshness better.<br /><br />The price point isn't bad, although I can get chips cheaper in larger bags at local grocery stores.<br /><br />Overall, a very good snack product in a very convenient size.<br /><br />Ingredients: Stone ground yellow corn, high oleic sunflower oil, brown rice flower, flax seeds, turbinado can sugar, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, soy flour, sea salt.<br /><br />One serving: 1 oz.

The most normal pancake we had made that we could make without egg or dairy was from Bisquick, but I always felt guilty serving those pancakes because the ingredients are processed and refined.

I've been in the market for a new favorite tea lately and had been trying countless varieties without much luck... everything just tasted too bland, or too strong, or just kind of ""off"" in general. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the balanced taste of this peppermint chocolate tea.<br /><br />The mint flavor is definitely present, but quite mild in comparison to many teas (think Celestial Seasoning's Peppermint Tea). Surprisingly, you can also taste the chocolate in this blend as well which is a problem I've had with other things I've tried recently like Guayaki's Mate Chocolatte. That's one of the things I really enjoy about this particular brand... no one flavor buries the other.<br /><br />Don't expect to take a sip of this tea and be reminded of hot chocolate though! It's nowhere near that rich of a chocolate flavor, and I'm glad for it. It makes for a nice cup of tea after a meal, and reminds me just enough of my favorite mint chocolate chip desserts to make an impact... and better yet, no fat or calories! If it's not sweet enough for you after brewing, it tastes pretty good with a little bit of Stevia added in my opinion and it'd probably be good with a little bit of cream added as well, although I don't think this particular blend needs it.<br /><br />Best of all, many of Republic of Tea's blends are Rooibos based which is a fantastic caffeine free tea chock full of antioxidants that are good for your body and help ward off illness.<br /><br />If you're bothered by the price it's possible to find this tea in stores a little cheaper, although the availability in your location may vary. I found mine at a World Market store for $10.99, which I first thought was still a bit steep... but upon tasting the tea and realizing that (unlike Zhena's Gypsy teas) this tin is sufficiently air tight which will allow me to reuse the tin for my loose leaf tea purchases in the future, I find the price to be quite reasonable.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this tea to anyone who enjoys chocolate mint, and for long time tea enthusiasts like myself who are looking for something new!"

However, after reading the other review, I asked the manager at a local pet food store what he thought of this brand, and he said it was NOT good - all fillers (corn) and animal by-products.  He suggested I gradually shift the dog to Blue, which has a similar protein/carbohydrate mix, and then when the puppy is a bit older (around a year), move to a food with a higher protein content.  (To ease the puppy into a new diet, he suggested I start by mixing 1/4 cup new food with 3/4 old food for a few days, then half and half, etc).  He also recommended that I mix in a couple of tablespoons of canned food with some water, just to make the dry food moist.  (He said the nutritional content of the canned food isn't as important, since the dry food will provide most of the substance, and that I can vary the canned food.)

Then they sell the dog food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.

The flavors, the oil content, and the bitterness differ dramatically based on how dark coffees are brewed. In the Cuisinart, you get a darn good cup of coffee for a autobrew system... but it will never taste the same as the same coffee brewed in a vacuum pot. This Peruvian Dark, done in the Cuisinart, has some light bitterness (as others have complained about...), a moderate oil content on the top of each cup, and the flavor is good-to-great. In the glass vacuum pot with water run through a Brita, it's the greatest coffee I've ordered and our favorite for winter mornings! No bitterness, a complexity that makes you savor the flavor, and a smell that fills the house. Use a coffee mug with a thin lip - Starbucks sells several. Like wine, you want it to spread across your tongue and open up all the flavor you can get out of it.

Smooth or crunchy?  ... either is fine. I've made my own peanut butter in the blender. I've sampled peanut butters from Africa, Europe, Australia and Asia. They are all interesting and every country seems to have its national favorite. I picked up a hankering for peanut butter sauced spaghetti in China. The g-kids love it, the wife and kids ... not so much ... it's the concept of peanut butter that I appreciate.<br /><br />In the US we have the giants of peanut butter ...  Jif, Skippy and Peter Pan (JSPP). Some stores carry a designer peanut butter brand at a premium price. In the end, the consistently barely discernible difference among JSPP is marginally irrelevant. Does anyone say `I hate Jif but love Skippy?'  No. JSPP at the lowest price delivers the commodity equivalently. I would doubt that a blind taste test could discriminate among JSPP.<br /><br />In the US market dominated by JSPP, Planters just seems to appear as a butter out of peanut land. I don't think I have ever seen Mr. Peanut on a peanut butter jar before (or, I could just not remember). Was this new? Was it `different? Well, here's what the Planters web site says:<br /><br />""Peanut butter had some growing up to do. And as the reigning peanut experts, who better to make it happen than Planters? After all, isn't it about time for a more sophisticated peanut butter?""<br /><br />Taste test result:<br />1. Planters is smoother. It rolls of the butter knife without tearing a hole in the bread.<br />2. I taste and smell more concentrated peanut flavor.<br />3. Planters doesn't tend to clump and hang off the uvula requiring milk to resolve (although milk is certainly my recommended choice for beverage pairing).<br />4. In my 'blind taste test', Planters wins. It is a noticeably better taste and less mouth desiccating.<br /><br />Decision:<br />Planters has something different to add to the grocery landscape of JSPP. 5-star good peanut butter and my new first choice (if the price is right).<br /><br />p.s. My wife, out of the blue, said ""Hey, that peanut butter you got is the best peanut butter I've ever tasted!"" ... that's a ""wow!"" vote."

My only deduction is for the added hydrogenated oils and sugar, which, although a nominal amount, is still unnecessary. As I mentioned above, I prefer the unadulterated peanut butters out there.

Your bread will not tear while you are spreading it on thickly.  The taste is so full of peanut goodness and flavor.  The smell?

He has been changed and updated over the years, but is still the same and easy to recognize peanut he has been for all these years.  Planters was established in the early 1900's by an Italian immigrant, Amedeo Obici, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  The company and their products have been around all this time due to their excellent and quality products.<br /><br />I had my 30 year old daughter blind taste test for me today.

But in recent years I've been stepping out on Jif because it is so processed and sweet, so I was delighted to review Planters creamy.<br /><br />My mom was the real peanut butter lover in the family. She believed that it was its own food group, one that needed eating each and every day. She also believed that peanut butter toast was a viable choice for breakfast, lunch OR dinner. In fact, as a kid I saw and heard so much peanut butter consumed that for most of my childhood years, I refused to touch the stuff. But a high school boyfriend wooing me with impromptu pb&j picnics got me to eat it, and I have it probably once a week, now.<br /><br />I think the taste quality of this is very high; very peanutty and not as sugary as most standard creamy brands. It tastes great with jam on toast, but isn't quite as strong in a sandwich, probably because of that lack of sugar to amp up the flavor. It's a more grown-up taste than Skippy or Jif, but still much more processed than the naturals that require stirring and tear up your bread (I like those too, don't get me wrong).<br /><br />As I said, I've been buying all kinds of brands for at least five years, so I am no longer a brand loyalist who is going to make a big switch.

It does spread well, but it's so oily--and I'm not talking about the natural variety either--that it slides off the sides of the bread.  I suppose this might be related to the fact that hydrogenated vegetable oil is the third ingredient on the list.<br /><br />Second, this peanut butter leaves a bitter aftertaste.  It doesn't really taste right.  I had to take a drink of water after every single bite to get the piece of cinnamon raisin toast I experimented with down.  It wasn't the cinnamon raisin bread I used either because I have bought the same brand--Sunmaid--for years.<br /><br />I do believe I will be sticking with my usual brand of peanut butter from here out.

So it spreads more easily and is easier to eat off a spoon, for example, than the store brands.<br /><br />I don't think the difference is life changing, so I'd probably make my judgment mostly on price, but I do think this is very good peanut butter, so if you are picky with respect to taste, and especially texture, this is good stuff.<br /><br />Finally, my wife made a batch of peanut butter cookies with the Planters, and we could tell absolutely no difference between cookies made with Planters and cookies made with the Aldi store brand.

I like how subtle the taste of Planters is, not overly sweet and strong the way Jif and Skippy are. I haven't had creamy peanut butter like this in a long time. Even the smooth version of Jif tends to clump, but not the Planters one - it's amazing easy to spread on bread. I also used half a cup of it for a chicken with peanut sauce recipe, and it was ideal. Because it's so smooth, it creates the perfect batter.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon Vine's generosity, I received 6 whole jars. However, my joy turned to disappointment when I saw that the expiration date on all six jars is November 11, 2011. My guess is that Amazon was trying to get rid of back inventory and decided to give it to Vine reviewers. I know peanut butter doesn't spoil easily, but most jars are dated at least two years ahead. So I'm tempted now to use up the butter as fast as possible. Oh well..."

There was no nutritional information or ingredients listed on the Amazon page so I had no idea when I ordered this that it contained hydrogenated oil and added sugar, making this a peanut butter that we will not get again as we try to avoid both of those things, there is no reason why peanut butter needs to have anything other than peanuts and salt in it.  I guess I would have hoped the first name in peanuts would have been smarter about making a peanut butter and gone with a natural one instead a sugar laden, transfat containing (less than 1 gram so they don't have to list it) spread."

Wismer ""Ron W""",0,1,4,1316649600,"Very good taste, but the heath concious beware","I taste tested Planters creamy peanut butter against two other brands of PB I have on my shelf. Skippy, Natural-SuperChunk and Smuckers's Natural Chunky. I separated out the peanut chunks from the chunky versions. The Planters was much smoother-almost buttery and slightly sweet. The others were grainy and thick. The Planters seemed to melt in my mouth.<br /><br />On the down side, the Planters contains ""hydrogenated vegetable oil"".  The label does not indicate ""fully"" or ""partially"" hydrogenated vegetable oil. This is an important distinction, as partially hydrogenated vegetable oil will contain trans-fat, but fully will not. Trans-fat has been implicated in heart disease (New York City has banned its use in restaurants). The Planters label says 0 trans- fat, but legally, the manufacturer is allowed to list 0 grams of trans-fat if the total amount in a serving is less than .5 grams. Therefore, until the manufacturer clearly labels the oil as 'fully' hydrogenated oil, eating this peanut butter every day might not be a great thing for your heart.<br /><br />Incidentally, the natural peanut butters I mentioned above do not have hydrogenated vegetable oil listed on their labels (but the Skippy, due to having palm oil in it, has 5 percent more saturated fat then the Planters-not good either!)."

I mean who doesn't associate peanuts and Planters?<br /><br />Overall, Planters Creamy peanut butter is very creamy and I was very impressed at how easily it spreads onto bread. There was no clumping or oil separation and this tastes great on sandwiches or as a spoonful right out of the jar. It's not as sweet as other peanut butters, which many may prefer.<br /><br />I do have to agree with another reviewer who was disappointed that the oil used was hydrogenated soybean oil. This means the oil was treated with hydrogen gas to increase shelf life and change texture, which also elevates your ""bad"" cholesterol and lowers your ""good"" cholesterol. Be sure to watch your intake of trans-fats as the American Heart Association recommends consuming less than 2 grams a day."
104726,B001KQI08C,A1H7O0UED9MA2E,Anoni,1,1,3,1323216000,Strange...,"Let me just say that this tea is about average. I feel like the tea wasn't made to high standards, but then you have the fact that they're whole leaves. I think this creates a weird situation where you have a bad product of high quality. I'm a supertaster, so I will describe the product as best as I can. It has your typical oolong bass notes, but the higher notes are very grassy (sometimes oolong is sweet, bitter...etc etc etc, this is grassy). It has a fair balance between bitterness and boldness. Incase you aren't gathering what I'm trying to say... it's a very neutral flavor and doesn't really 'wow' me at all. The grassy flavor taste exactly like wheaties cereal (no frosted).... and that sounds stupid but when you try it you'll instantly make the connection.<br /><br />So, in conclusion it's a plain tea that I won't really hold up high on my tea shrines, but it does have one last unique quality. It taste odd, but I can't stop drinking it. It's like raman noodles... you never say ""man I can sure go for some raman"", but when you are actually eating raman you make sure you eat every last noodle. It's like that.<br /><br />12/10/11 EDIT: After drinking a few of these, I can say that it's a great tea to drink without anything added. I normally add sugar to most of my teas in some way or another (honey, sugar, guava), but I find that this tea is actually really good without anything added. I'm not going to officially change my 3 star rating, but I am tempted to bump it up to 4 stars."

Now if you like instant coffee then you will probably like these, BUT you could save money by buying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M1KTUA"">Nescafe Clasico Instant Coffee</a>, adding a spoonful to your cup and then brewing just hot water through your Keurig.

It tastes reasonably close to the store-bought variety, but is not that thick oozy stuff that comes from the store. So far I have used it to marinate chicken and it seems to work great, and augment or replace regular milk in other recipes. Seem fine. The plan is it check it out as a scratch mix substitute for store bought box mixes and dressings, but first I have to use up the store box mixes and dressing. The four bags from Amazon may last quite a while, but according to Bob's shelf life specifications, it should be fine."

She's a huge tea fan, so that is definitely saying something.  So, I've upped my star rating to a 4 (that's the average of my opinion (3) and her opinion (5)).  In light of her reaction, this tea may well be worth a try.]<br /><br />Original review:<br />I live in Japan where we drink oolong tea daily.  I usually buy my flavored teas in the US, because here in Japan they emphasize the aroma of the tea as it is brews rather than the taste, whereas in the US they emphasize the quality of the taste over the quality of the aroma.  This offers nothing outstanding in either area.  The aroma is present but nothing fantastic, and I can't taste the apricot in this at all.<br /><br />This is an upper medium-grade oolong tea, not the delicate high-grade Chinese oolong I was expecting at this price.  This is important because oolong tea is stunning when high-grade, perfectly nasty when low-grade, and merely OK when medium-grade.  It's upper medium-grade, so still very good, but not the stunning flavor I was expecting at this price.  (On reflection, perhaps the high price comes from the fact that it is organic, rather than from using only the highest-grade tea leaves.)<br /><br />Visually all the teas from this series are very appealing and they are ready to give ""as is"" if you need a housewarming gift, gift for your child's teacher, etc.  The package closes securely so you don't need to worry about the tea leaves not keeping well."

After less than a minute of whisking, the matcha created a nice blanket of foam. The first sip was heavenly and after adding some agave, the cheesecake flavor popped even more. This has become one of my favorite matchas and I'm excited to mix it with other flavors and make signature flavored cheesecakes."

But real life stepped in and I didn't have the time to give it the attention it deserved, so, well, I had to wait to try. But I wait no more! Today I got to mix up my first frothy cup of cheesecake matcha goodness. I was stuck at the location I hate at work, so I desperately needed a thermos of matcha comfort and boy oh boy was I not let down! This is amazing stuff. Creamy and just that touch of tang found in a good cheesecake....yum. One of my specialities around this time of year is a pumpkin cheesecake....nom. I can't wait to mix this with a touch of Pumpkin Pie matcha and see how they go together.<br /><br />Oh cheesecake, I have missed you desperately. Cream cheese is one of those things I absolutely cannot have or I'll be ill for days, so cheesecake is, unfortunately permanently off my menu. But with a little beauty like this in my tea cupboard, I find I don't mind nearly as much! I want to try mixing this with all of the flavors in the Red Leaf Tea catalogue, and I'm sure every one of them would be delicious!"
104989,B0092VQLZG,AS9UB97EO5PD7,Meghan Donovan,0,0,5,1348963200,Can't go wrong with cheesecake.,"Cheesecake matcha basically sounds like a dream come true. I'm not sure why I didn't order this with my first order. If I can get matcha that will satisfy my cheesecake craving without all the calories, I am definitely going to try it!<br /><br />I received this with my order of tiramisu and caramel, and although it had the least distinctive smell and flavour, it definitely still had an authentic cheesecakey-ness that was so worth it. I think the best part of this was that it wasn't just matcha that tasted like cheesecake - it tastes like what I imagine matcha-flavoured cheesecake would taste like (I haven't ventured into the world of baking with matcha because I am the only one who would eat it and I really don't need to eat an entire batch of cookies, cheesecake, etc. By myself!).<br /><br />Sweet, but not too sweet, with that little hint of tanginess that you get from cream cheese, this is a perfect after-dinner tea. I am going to make it again and do a better job - I had it iced the first time, and I think that is how I will prefer it, but it wasn't quite cold enough. I took it to work in my timolino and forgot to put ice cubes in!  That will be a necessity next time. I can't wait to mix this with a few other flavours!"

I wasn't quite sure about ordering this one as I wasn't sure if I would like the cheesecake flavour... well I'm glad I did add this one to my cart as it was worth every cent. I make this one half matcha half milk and I've been adding marshmallows it makes it a bit more fun (and fancy!) The cost is reasonable the company's customer service is fantastic. There is no reason you can't order this tasty treat right now :D Just writing about it makes me want another cup :D

I have tried three flavoured matchas from Red Leaf, and they are quickly becoming my favourite beverages.<br /><br />This particular matcha has a full, creamy flavour and texture. You can almost even taste the cream cheese tang. There's also a bit of cookie-crust going on here, which I love!<br /><br />When I first opened the packet I was delighted with the aroma. It smells sweet and decadent, almost reminded me of matcha ice cream! Must be the sweet creaminess of the cheesecake flavour combined with that familiar, distinctive matcha scent I know and love.<br /><br />This one has become a staple for me, and although there are lots of different flavours I'd love to try, I know I'll always make sure to have some of this on hand. It is so delicious and versatile."

This cheesecake matcha is seriously smooth and has a very strong aroma that makes me want to double check and make sure there isn't any actual cheesecake somewhere in my kitchen. I've had this matcha several times now and each time this flavor is spot on to a real, creamy cheesecake. You can find out more about this matcha here (and pick up some for yourself!):[...]<br /> Initially, I tried this matcha traditionally in my chawan and it was creamy and rich. I was pleasantly surprised that the color was a vibrant green instead of being muddled by the flavoring. Even though the cheesecake flavor is front and center, it is tempered nicely with a smooth, fresh matcha aftertaste that prevents the flavor from being cloying. The matcha also whisked up quite well with no noticeable clumps and I didn't even sift it!<br /><br /> After the initial success with this matcha, I couldn't wait to try it as a hot cheesecake latte. Although the thought of hot liquid cheesecake is not necessarily my idea of a great treat, I was confident that the quality of Red Leaf Tea's product would not let me down. With a bit of sugar and the addition of warm milk, this latte was so great! I downed it in no time flat and had to make another immediately.<br /><br /> Tonight, I'm having this as a cold iced matcha with a teensy bit of sugar and enough milk to complete the cup. The flavor seems to really pop when prepared this way and I'm certainly wondering how I made it for so many days without drinking this or any other of the great flavors from Red Leaf Tea. A couple of weeks ago I made a delicious matcha cake and I think it would be amazing with this cheesecake flavor as the base! Now to figure out what the next flavor I'll try will be..."

If you love cheesecake, or are even on the fence about it, try this matcha.  It's like biting into the best cheesecake slice you can imagine without the guilt of calories and sugar!"
104994,B0092VQLZG,A3J6TE3SKSYBUI,Daisy Chubb (Ash-Lee),0,0,5,1347580800,Dreams really do come true!,"Okay, I was wracking my brain to think of which matcha I had left to review. I actually had to go into my cupboard and sort my Recently Added to figure it out... it was CHEESECAKE! How could I forget?! I've been drinking this glorious Matcha almost every day, not even kidding. I know it'll be the first I run out of and the first I run back to order more of! I might get a tin just for this one, because I know it will be in my cupboard forever. Dear Red Leaf Tea, never stop making matcha!!!! Love, your adoring fans!<br /><br />I have had 2 amazing cheesecakes in my life. One was purchased on a trip to Vancouver from the market on Granville Island. It was tiny. It was expensive. It was amazing! The second was this week from a place called Broadway Cheesecake (something like that) here in Halifax. They have so freaking many kinds of cheesecake, it is crazy! 8 bucks a piece, but the pieces are HUGE. Why am I telling you this? Because this matcha trumps them. It puts the power of cheesecake into my little hands, adds green tea powder to make it amazing, and tastes like heaven on earth!<br /><br />That may seem a little dramatic, but it's the only way I know how to truly show how much I appreciate this matcha in my cupboard. The taste is tangy, thick and a bit sweet. If you add sugar it has the decadence of a perfect cream cheese icing. If you add milk (I tried 2%, almond and vanilla soy) it's a slice from a fine bakery (or cheesecake from home, arguably the best kind!). If you drink it hot - it's fresh from the oven! Iced? It's a perfectly chilled and dense New York piece from the fridge. I could go on, but I guess what I'm trying to say is: Any way you slice it, this Cheesecake Matcha is the best of the best - it has the power to turn my crappy tired morning into an awesome day. Just sayin'.<br /><br />One of the best features of this flavour (and many of the other dessert matchas) is that you get the delicious taste of a rich cheesecake without the tummy-ache and super full and heavy feeling. I won't say without the ""guilt"" because I am highly against self shaming, especially in the food department. With that in mind - this tea doesn't completely replace a cheesecake. I'll still eat my fair share of cheesecake! What this tea DOES do is let you have cheesecake every day - even if your tummy is full or your wallet is empty! THAT my friends, is the magic of matcha :D<br /><br />Thanks for reading this ramble. I'm kind of passionate, can you tell? ;)"

No calories!<br />This tea is creamy and tangy and makes quite a comforting cup!<br />I think that it would be delicious with a splash of milk or some sugar, but it is enjoyable by itself."

The cheesecake flavor really comes through, adding a creamy decadence to the cup along with cheesecake's signature tang and even a little bit of crusty goodness. It doesn't overwhelm the matcha flavor but balances with it, making this sweet treat not overly dessert-y but great for drinking any time of day. It's great straight or as an iced latte, perfect for a mid-afternoon pick me up! All the taste, none of the calories--what more could you want?"
104997,B0092VQLZG,A17HUNR8HP7S5,Will Work For Tea,0,0,5,1346803200,Will Work For Tea,"Another winner from Red Leaf Tea!<br /><br />The smell of the this particular matcha is tangy and slightly sweet, even though there's no sugar added to the flavoring.  I prepared this my usual way - cold latte style.  Two ounces of warmed water with a teaspoon of matcha and a half teaspoon of super-fine sugar - wisk until blended.  I didn't try sifting the matcha this time, and it frothed up very nicely without any clumping.  Six ounces of cold, creamy whole milk and the taste was so smooth and creamy with a bit of tang - just how I like my cheesecake to be!<br /><br />After my first cup as a cold latte, I went for a second cup  - this time as a warmed, straight matcha.  The tang and creaminess are much less noticable the second time around, but the matcha base is much more prevalent.  As the cup cools, the tangy taste comes to the forefront with the matcha and the creaminess lags behind.  It's kind of like having two very different teas, which is pretty awesome for just buying the one!  A creamy, dessert-like cup of tangy cheesecake with milk/dairy alternative or a green tea with a little tang - it's up to whatever kind of mood you're in!"
104998,B0092VQLZG,A38RWVWOQPYJSA,LiberTEAS,0,0,5,1346716800,"Cheesecake, anyone?  Why, YES please!!!","I've tried this prepared a couple of different ways now.  The first time I prepared it, I prepared it the way I would most Matcha - in the traditional way in my chawan (tea bowl) and whisking it until smooth and frothy.  It is good that way.  It has a delicious, creamy taste.  Sweet.  Really good, and tasting very much like cheesecake.<br /><br />However, if you really want the FULL cheesecake experience, I recommend drinking this one as a latte, using warmed milk instead of water and whisking with a frothing tool instead of the bamboo whisk.  YUM!  The creamier texture and flavor that comes from using milk instead of water is really beneficial to this cheesecake flavored Matcha.  All the flavor remains intact - it is not masked by the milk - and it tastes creamier and richer ... and let's face it, when you want cheesecake, you want that rich, creamy flavor and texture.<br /><br />This cheesecake flavored Matcha is rich, smooth, and sweet, with the distinctive tangy taste of cream cheese and even a hint of buttery pastry.  It makes a delightful pick-me-up for the afternoon, especially if you're craving something a little sweet.  This will help curb those cravings for a fraction of the calories and fat!"

I still am amazed that Red Leaf Tea can get such excellent flavor from all natural sources into a matcha!<br /><br />This flavor melded perfectly with the green tea base giving it a beautiful slightly sweet and creamy earthy flavor! I imagine it would be insanely good in a white base as well!<br /><br />You can almost taste the crumbly cheesecake crust in this as well as the taste of the filling so you do get that whole cheesecake experience."

Better than Celestial<br />Fusion Breakfast - Too much going on- mix of Indian Assam, Indonesian Black, Chinese Green, Japanese Green, African Black, and Japanese Matcha<br />Fusion Green & White - Good if you can't decide to have white tea or green tea, which happens every so often to me<br />Ginger Peach - not my cuppa, too much ginger and difficult to find the peach flavor<br />Organic Premium Green - very good<br />Moroccan Mint - Excellent, not quite as minty as peppermint herbal tea, but a nice balance of mint and green flavors<br />Pomegranate Raspberry - meh, okay when you're craving fruity but I wouldn't invest in a case of this<br />Premium Green - very good<br />Decaf Premium Green - Excellent, my kids drink this often<br /><br />After drinking tea for years with or without sweetener (no milk) I made a mistake one morning and put <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2RC"">Torani Sugar-Free Vanilla Syrup</a> into my tea with some cream (thinking it was coffee!) and I was blown away with the smooth, mellow taste. I now drink my tea with a little vanilla syrup and cream (less than I would use in coffee) and it's such an amazing flavor - like dessert. My daughter thinks it tastes like Yoplait vanilla yogurt. I highly recommend this!!!"
